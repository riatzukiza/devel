## Plan: Remove stdio proxy functionality and support only HTTP MCP tools

### Phase 1: Discovery & requirements alignment
- Inventory current stdio proxy implementations (`src/proxy`, `src/core/...`, tests) and HTTP MCP integration points
- Capture dependencies in docs/specs referencing stdio usage and MCP SDK expectations
- Identify runtime/config flags controlling transports (stdio vs HTTP)
- Confirm scope boundaries with existing MCP SDK HTTP tooling support
- Definition of done: understanding documented in spec draft, impacted files listed with references
- Validation: existing unit/integration tests enumerated for later updates

### Phase 2: Refine design & migration strategy
- Decide removal approach (delete modules? feature flags?) ensuring HTTP-only flow works
- Plan config/schema updates and migration path (deprecations, docs updates)
- Outline test changes (remove stdio tests, enhance HTTP ones)
- Update spec with steps + acceptance criteria per module/test/doc
- Validation: design review via spec ready for approval

### Phase 3: Implementation & validation (future execution)
- Sequentially remove stdio proxy code per spec while keeping build/tests passing after each sub-phase (e.g., transport removal, config updates, docs/tests)
- Run targeted + full test suites to ensure HTTP MCP support only
- Update docs/readmes + changelog communicating breaking change
- Validation: `pnpm test` (or relevant subsets) green; HTTP MCP flows proven via existing integration tests

### Progress 2025-11-17
- Completed Phase 1 discovery: inventoried stdio proxy code paths and documented impacted files/tests.
- Authored `spec/remove-stdio-proxy.md` capturing requirements, phased approach, and open questions for review.
