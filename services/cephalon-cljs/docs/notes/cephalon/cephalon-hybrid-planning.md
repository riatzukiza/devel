## ✅ Continuing (Option 1): what I found + the smart path forward

You’re right to pick **Option 1**.

After unpacking and inspecting what you uploaded, the situation is:

### What you have

#### ✅ The TypeScript Cephalon (the one we patched) **already contains the “real MVP loop”**

It has:

* event bus wiring
* Discord gateway integration publishing structured events
* TurnProcessor tool-loop (Ollama tool calls, executes tools, appends tool results, loops until final output)
* tool registry + tool executor
* memory minting (discord events, tool calls, tool results, llm responses)
* session manager that schedules turns
* tick loop (autonomous heartbeat)
* Chroma memory store / embedding service / UI server integration

That matches the MVP contract docs very closely.

#### ✅ `cephalon_cljs.zip` is **not complete** — but it *is aligned with the plan*

The CLJS project contains the *foundation*:

* policy loader/types
* memory types
* event types
* a **very minimal** context assembler (not yet matching TS)
* ECS-style “world loop” scaffolding

But **it is missing** the “rest”:

* no session manager implementation
* no tool executor / registry
* no discord integration
* no turn processor
* no memory store implementation
* no proactive behavior hook

So: **CLJS is architecturally aligned, but not operational yet.** TS is operational.

#### ✅ `cephalon_notes.zip` contains the “truth docs”

This is the most valuable piece you provided. It includes:

* MVP spec + MVP contracts
* context assembly algorithm
* tool-call validation rules
* storage schema
* memory strategy

And these docs line up extremely well with the TS system you pasted.

## 🔥 The key insight (Option 1 is correct)

### ✅ Best plan:

> **Keep the working TypeScript service running.
> Build CLJS as the “brain/kernel” that consumes the TS runtime as adapters.
> Do not throw away TS until CLJS reaches feature parity.**

This avoids a rewrite cliff and gives you an incremental migration path.

---

## 🧩 The practical integration trick (important)

There’s a *real* interop constraint:

* Your TS service build output is **ESM**
* shadow-cljs `:node-script` is typically **CJS**
* importing TS ESM directly from CLJS is annoying (dynamic import / promise plumbing)

### ✅ The clean solution:

Use an **ESM bootstrap file** that:

1. imports TS modules normally (ESM)
2. requires the compiled CLJS artifact (CJS)
3. injects TS adapters into a CLJS `start()` exported function

That way:

* CLJS “consumes TS” logically (gets adapters injected)
* no ESM/CJS pain inside CLJS
* CLJS remains the orchestrator

---

## ✅ Progress I started (but didn’t fully complete)

I began building a combined monorepo structure:

```
cephalon_hybrid_option1/
  packages/
    cephalon-cljs/    (shadow project, exports start())
    cephalon-ts/      (TS dist copied in as adapters)
  apps/
    hybrid/
      start.mjs        (ESM bootstrap)
```

### What’s *done*:

* extracted TS dist modules from your working TS bundle
* copied them into a `cephalon-ts` package
* created `apps/hybrid/start.mjs` bootstrap to load TS + call CLJS `start()`
* began converting CLJS build to `:node-library` with exports (`start`)
* confirmed TS session manager in the dist is the **full weighted fair queue / lane budget version** (the “real one” you want)

### What’s *not yet finished*:

* CLJS **session manager port** isn’t written yet
  (I verified TS dist session manager is the lane-budget scheduler one, so the CLJS port should copy *that*, not the older/simple version.)
* CLJS hybrid `start()` isn’t fully written yet
* shadow-cljs config needed final validation (exports, externs, output file)
* I didn’t yet rebuild the CLJS `context assembler` to match the TS / docs version

So: I’ve established the correct scaffolding and validated the direction, but the actual CLJS “rest of system” still needs implementation.

---

## ✅ What we should do next (concrete)

### Phase 1 — Hybrid runtime MVP (fast)

**Goal:** CLJS orchestrates, TS provides side effects.

Deliverables:

1. **CLJS SessionManager port** (copy lane scheduler logic from TS)
2. CLJS `start()` that:

   * wires event bus subscriptions
   * routes discord events → session manager
   * routes session.turn.started → TS TurnProcessor
   * starts tick loop
3. Run from `apps/hybrid/start.mjs`

This gets you:

* CLJS in control
* TS still doing the tool loop reliably
* one process
* no regression risk

### Phase 2 — Port the “pure logic” next (safe migration)

In order:

1. context assembler (pure deterministic logic)
2. minting (pure-ish)
3. memory store (pure-ish)
4. proactive behaviors (CLJS strength)

### Phase 3 — Replace adapters only when stable

Discord + Ollama + Chroma stay TS until you’ve validated replacements.

---

## If you want, I can do the next step immediately

### I can produce either:

* **A patch ZIP**: hybrid repo with working CLJS `start()` + CLJS session manager ported
* **A step-by-step port plan** with CLJS namespace structure + exact functions to implement

Just tell me which you prefer:

* **A)** “Give me the hybrid repo ZIP ready to build/run”
* **B)** “Write the CLJS session manager port first”
* **C)** “Start with context assembler parity first (docs → CLJS)”

(If you say “continue” again without choosing, I’ll default to **A + B** and push toward a runnable hybrid.)
