# Define “all its glory” as 5 concrete capabilities

## Context
- Source note: `services/cephalon-cljs/docs/notes/root/2026.02.02.17.12.43.md`
- Category: `root`

## Draft Requirements
- **Always_on_loop**
- ticks on a schedule
- can pause/resume
- never wedges itself (timeouts, retries, circuit_breaker)
- **Tool_native_agent**
- discovers environment via tools (not prompt magic)
- tool calls are validated, logged, replayable
- idempotent where possible
- **Memory_that_matters**
- short_term_context (what’s happening now)
- long_term_memory (facts + preferences + summaries)
- retrieval that’s predictable (not “hope the embed works”)

## Summary Snippets
- ([Past chat][1])([Past chat][1])([Past chat][1])([Past chat][1])([Past chat][2])
- Yeah — if **Cephalon “in all its glory”** is the north star, that’s valid.

## Open Questions
- What should be implemented first from this note?
- Which parts are exploratory versus actionable?
