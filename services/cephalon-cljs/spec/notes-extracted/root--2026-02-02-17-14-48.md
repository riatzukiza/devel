# Cephalon v1 as a real, shippable “alive loop”

## Context
- Source note: `services/cephalon-cljs/docs/notes/root/2026.02.02.17.14.48.md`
- Category: `root`

## Draft Requirements
- **discover**: list channels
- **choose**: pick 1 channel deterministically (policy-based)
- **read**: fetch last 100 messages
- **summarize**: produce a short public summary message
- **remember**: store structured memory about that channel
- **persist**: save the full turn to disk/db
- **survive**: if tools fail or model outputs junk, it recovers and tries again next tick
- multi-agent orchestration
- cross-server “personality arcs”
- deep semantic retrieval
- complex task planning
- training / eval harness beyond basic metrics

## Summary Snippets
- You said “continue” — so here’s the next layer down: **the contracts + data shapes + loop rules** that make Milestone_1 not just “works once”, but **boringly repeatable**.

## Open Questions
- What should be implemented first from this note?
- Which parts are exploratory versus actionable?
