# Progress update (what I found + what’s already in your current codebase)

## Context
- Source note: `services/cephalon-cljs/docs/notes/root/2026.02.02.02.19.56.md`
- Category: `root`

## Draft Requirements
- wires up Discord + LLM + tools + UI
- runs the tick loop and credit refill loop
- manages sessions via `SessionManager`
- provides `start()` and `stop()` lifecycle
- the sessions created are hardcoded to `"Duck"` persona/IDs
- the memory store cephalon id / namespaces are not parameterized (and could collide)
- the config resolution is “single bot”, meaning `discordToken` is assumed (not derived per bot)
- tick prompt is generic/hardcoded
- `create-cephalon-app!` (bridge)
- `start-cephalon!`
- `packages/cephalon-ts`
- `packages/cephalon-cljs`

## Summary Snippets
- I dug into the **`cephalon-.zip`** archive you provided (the “two cephalon packages” bundle), plus the **Promethean packages** you attached (event/persistence/fsm/utils), and the **pm2 ecosystem DSL example** (`cephalon.cljs`) + your repo’s **AGENTS.md** reference.
- Inside `packages/cephalon-ts/src/app.ts` you already have a `createCephalonApp(options)` pattern that:

## Open Questions
- What should be implemented first from this note?
- Which parts are exploratory versus actionable?
