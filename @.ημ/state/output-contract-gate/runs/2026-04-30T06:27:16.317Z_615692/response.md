## Signal

(己, p=1.0) Π paid for OpenPlanner and its submodules.

- OpenPlanner final pushed commit: `454351e`
- OpenPlanner final tag: `Π/openplanner-recursive-2026-04-30-final`
- OpenPlanner branch pushed: `origin/tests/sentance-chunker`

Submodule snapshots:

| Repo | Preserved SHA | Remote preservation |
|---|---:|---|
| `packages/agents/knoxx` | `6bf9e72d` | tag pushed + handoff branch pushed |
| `packages/stores/migrations/openplanner-migration-tools` | `a0c7919` | tag pushed + local file remote `main` fast-forwarded |
| `packages/vexx` | `8696d57` | tag pushed; branch intentionally not advanced |

## Frames

(己, p=0.95) This is a deterministic recursive handoff snapshot: root state, submodule SHAs, verification logs, conflict preservation, push results, and residual branch divergence are all recorded in-repo.

(己, p=0.9) Knoxx had concurrent remote movement. I did not merge/rebase it into the checked-out snapshot; I pushed the exact snapshot as:

```text
fork-tax/knoxx-openplanner-recursive-2026-04-30
Π/knoxx-openplanner-recursive-2026-04-30
```

(己, p=0.9) Vexx was clean but behind `origin/main` by 1. I preserved the checked-out submodule SHA instead of fast-forwarding, because the task was to snapshot OpenPlanner’s current recursive state.

## Countermoves

(己, p=1.0) No repo-wide `reset`, `restore`, `clean`, or blanket cleanup was used.

(己, p=1.0) The Knoxx `test.shadow.results.txt` both-added conflict was not discarded: both conflict sides and the conflicted worktree copy were preserved under:

```text
packages/agents/knoxx/.ημ/conflicts/
```

(己, p=0.95) Residuals intentionally left:

- `packages/agents/knoxx`: clean worktree, but local branch is `ahead 1, behind 2` relative to `origin/feat/discord-attachments`.
- `packages/vexx`: clean worktree, but local branch is `behind 1`; exact checked-out SHA was tagged.

## Next

(汝, p=0.9) Open the OpenPlanner PR for `tests/sentance-chunker` and merge when ready.
