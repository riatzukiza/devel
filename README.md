# devel — the development tree

`/home/err/devel` is a **development tree of independently-owned git repos**, organized
under `orgs/**`, plus a workspace root carrying shared documentation, tooling, and
automation. Each org repo is its own repository with its own history, branch law, and
license; the root ties them together with shared scripts (`bb.edn`, `bin/`, `scripts/`),
a pnpm workspace, kanban task cards, and chronological notes.

This root itself is the `riatzukiza/devel` git repo. The active device branch is
`device/yoga` (see `AGENTS.md` for the device-federation rules).

> **Note on legacy content:** the bulk of this file (below the `Legacy` marker) is the
> pre-existing README content, which actually documents the **proxx** proxy
> (`orgs/open-hax/proxx`, deployed from `services/proxx`). It is preserved verbatim
> under its new heading; `DEVEL.md` at the root is its workspace-flavored twin.

## Quick Start

**Where things live**

- `orgs/open-hax`, `orgs/octave-commons`, `orgs/riatzukiza`, `orgs/shuv`,
  `orgs/ussyverse` — groups of independently-owned repositories (see
  *Repository Structure* below).
- `docs/` — shared workspace documentation: `docs/agile/tasks/` (the kanban board),
  `docs/notes/` (chronological notes), research, specs, reports.
- `bb.edn` — Babashka task runner for the Clojure side of the workspace (REPLs,
  shadow-cljs builds, tests, lint). See `CLOJURE.md` for the full walkthrough and
  `./repl.sh` for starting REPLs.
- `package.json` + `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — root pnpm workspace; workspace packages
  live under `packages/*` and selected `orgs/**` packages. Use
  `pnpm --filter <pkg> <script>` to build/test a specific package.
- `nx.json` — Nx is available for affected-project detection across the workspace.

**Build / test a TypeScript (pnpm) package**

```bash
pnpm install                      # workspace install (root)
pnpm --filter @workspace/open-hax-openai-proxy dev    # example: run proxx API
pnpm --filter @workspace/open-hax-openai-proxy test   # example: run its tests
```

Stack registries (docker compose wrappers) are managed from the root:
`pnpm docker:stack status <stack>` — see `docs/docker-stacks.md`.

**Clojure / ClojureScript work**

```bash
./repl.sh all        # JVM REPL, CLJS REPL, MCP server, shadow-cljs watch
bb test:all          # run tests across runtimes
bb lint:all          # lint Clojure + ClojureScript
```

See `CLOJURE.md` for ports, config files (`deps.edn`, `shadow-cljs.edn`), and the
dev workflow. Runtime ladder: NBB (node) → Babashka → JVM → shadow-cljs (browser).

**Navigating orgs/**

Each repo under `orgs/<org>/<repo>` is an independent git checkout. `cd` in and treat
it as its own repo (its own README, its own branch law). Some repos also have
`~origin_main` sibling worktrees. Root-level symlinks exist for hot paths
(`promethean -> orgs/riatzukiza/promethean`, `desktop -> orgs/riatzukiza/desktop`).

## Example

One concrete flow — the proxx proxy, whose docs are preserved below:

```bash
cd /home/err/devel/orgs/open-hax/proxx   # repo checkout (service runtime: ../services/proxx)
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env && cp keys.example.json keys.json
pnpm test
```

When in doubt about a given org repo, read that repo's own README/package.json —
conventions are per-repo, not per-root.

## Concepts

- **org-per-repo ownership** — every project is its own repository under an org
  directory. The root repo (`riatzukiza/devel`) owns only the shared surface:
  docs, tooling, services scaffolding, workspace manifests.
- **kanban tasks dir as the board** — `docs/agile/tasks/*.md` cards carry YAML
  frontmatter (`uuid`, `status`, `priority`). Work is requested and tracked there;
  statuses observed today: mostly `"incoming"`, with a few `todo`/`completed`.
- **bb.edn as the root scripting runtime** — Babashka tasks orchestrate REPLs,
  builds, tests, and workspace setup for all Clojure projects.
- **notes/ chronology** — `docs/notes/` files are timestamped (`YYYY.MM.DD.*.md`)
  chronological evidence of decisions and sessions; treat as semi-structured
  scratchpad (per `docs/README.md`).

## Development

- Root-level lint/typecheck for TypeScript uses the workspace skills/commands
  (`workspace-lint`, `workspace-typecheck`); markdown lint via
  `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`.
- `nx.json` supports affected detection across submodules.
- PM2 process definitions: `ecosystem.pm2.edn`, `ecosystem.config.cjs` (+ dev and
  container variants).
- Runtime state and agent ledgers (`receipts.edn`, `receipts.log`, `.ημ/`) live at
  the root; see `AGENTS.md`.

## Status

**Known issues**

- **`.gitmodules` / index drift:** `.gitmodules` maps ~60 submodule entries, but the
  index currently holds only a handful of gitlinks. `git submodule status` fails with
  `fatal: no submodule mapping found in .gitmodules for path 'orgs/octave-commons/bitch-tracker'`.
  Documented in `GIT_MODULE_INDEX.md` and `AGENTS.md`; do **not** try to "fix" it
  casually — submodule surgery is its own task.
- `device/yoga` was created from `main` with WIP carried across (device-scoped branch
  law; do not switch branches casually).
- A number of nested repo clones (≈24 at device-creation time) had **no commits**
  (empty clones) and were skipped from tracking.

## Documentation

- `docs/README.md` — start-here index, `docs/MASTER_CROSS_REFERENCE_INDEX.md`
- `DEVEL.md` — proxx dev instructions (workspace flavor)
- `CLOJURE.md` — Clojure environment guide
- `AGENTS.md` — agent skills + device federation rules
- `PROCESS.md` — workspace process charter
- `STYLE.md` — conventions
- `GLOSSARY.md` — domain + lore + Clojure terms
- `GIT_MODULE_INDEX.md` — parent/children repo index
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — legacy proxy contribution flow (staging-first; note it is
  proxx-scoped, not root-scoped)

## Contributing

Most work happens **inside the individual org repos** (branch + PR there, per each
repo's own policy), not at the devel root. Root-level changes (docs, tooling,
task cards) land on `device/*` branches of `riatzukiza/devel` and merge to `main`.

## License

No single root license. Licensing is **per org repo** — check each repo's
LICENSE file (e.g. `orgs/octave-commons/promethean/LICENSE.txt` is GPL). The
devel root itself carries no top-level LICENSE file.

# Open Hax OpenAI Proxy

OpenAI-compatible proxy server with provider-scoped account rotation.

DEVEL instructions live in `DEVEL.md`.

## Features

- `POST /v1/chat/completions` compatibility endpoint.
- Multi-provider routing through one OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- Model-aware upstream routing for Claude models: `claude-*` can be sent to upstream `POST /v1/messages` and converted back into chat-completions format.
- Model-aware upstream routing: `gpt-*` models are sent to upstream `POST /v1/responses` and converted back into chat-completions format.
- Preserves reasoning traces when translating Responses/Messages payloads by mapping them to OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_content` in non-stream and synthetic stream responses.
- Maps OpenAI-style reasoning controls (`reasoning_effort` / `reasoning.effort`) into Claude `thinking` payloads: `none` disables thinking, `low|medium|high|xhigh` map to safe Claude budgets, and auto-routed plain `claude-*` traffic gets the same protection.
- Model-aware routing to OpenAI provider: models prefixed with `openai/` or `openai:` route to configured OpenAI endpoints.
- Global fast-mode toggle for Responses traffic: the proxy can inject `service_tier: "priority"` for GPT/Responses requests, with per-request overrides still respected.
- Model-aware routing to Ollama base API: models prefixed with `ollama/` or `ollama:` are sent to Ollama `POST /api/chat`.
- Built-in React/Vite console with a usage dashboard plus Chat, Credentials, and Tools/MCP pages.
- OpenAI OAuth browser + device flows based on OpenCode Codex plugin behavior (PKCE, state, callback exchange, account extraction).
- Chroma-backed semantic history search with lexical fallback for chat session recall.
- `GET /v1/models` and `GET /v1/models/:id` model listing.
- `GET /v1/models` merges static models with live Ollama/Ollama Cloud catalogs when configured.
- Auto-aliases tagged Ollama families to the largest variant (for example `qwen3.5` -> `qwen3.5:397b`).
- Provider-scoped account rotation when upstream returns rate limits (`429`, plus `403/503` with `retry-after`).
- Cross-provider fallback for shared models (for example `vivgrid` <-> `ollama-cloud`) when one provider's keys or upstream path fails.
- Flexible `keys.json` supports both API-key and OAuth bearer accounts, with multiple accounts per provider.

## Standalone Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-hax/proxx.git
cd proxx
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
cp keys.example.json keys.json
cp models.example.json models.json # optional preferences; discovery is canonical
```

Required setup:

- Put real provider credentials in one of: `keys.json`, `PROXY_KEYS_JSON` / `UPSTREAM_KEYS_JSON`, or the configured SQL store via `DATABASE_URL`
- Set `PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env` unless you are only doing local unauthenticated debugging
- Adjust `UPSTREAM_*`, `OPENAI_*`, `OLLAMA_*`, optional `CHROMA_*`, and optional `OTEL_*` settings in `.env` for your environment
- If you enable OTEL export, set your own collector endpoint and auth headers through environment variables rather than hardcoding them in tracked files

Alternative credential sources:

- `PROXY_KEYS_JSON` / `UPSTREAM_KEYS_JSON` can carry the same JSON payload inline when you cannot rely on a mounted `keys.json` (for example Render)
- When `DATABASE_URL` is configured, SQL-backed credentials are also loaded and become the runtime source of truth for the proxy UI and request routing
- `DISABLED_PROVIDER_IDS` can remove providers such as `vivgrid` from live routing without deleting their stored credentials

## Shared-state federation v1

If you want several `proxx` instances to behave like one mirrored operator surface, point them at the same `DATABASE_URL`.

In this mode the shared SQL database becomes the control plane for:
- GitHub/UI operator login state and tenant membership
- tenant API keys and proxy settings
- provider credentials, including OpenAI OAuth accounts added through the UI
- dashboard / analytics usage data

That means:
- add an OpenAI OAuth account on one instance -> the other instances can pick it up from the same DB-backed credential store
- usage analytics aggregate across the fleet instead of fragmenting per instance

Current boundary:
- shared in v1: operator/admin state, tenant API keys and proxy settings, provider credentials including OAuth accounts, analytics
- still local for now: chat sessions, prompt affinity, and other convenience file state

Env-backed providers:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` automatically exposes an `openrouter` provider route.
- `REQUESTY_API_TOKEN` (or `REQUESTY_API_KEY`) automatically exposes a `requesty` provider route.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` automatically exposes a `gemini` provider route (native Gemini REST via `generateContent`).
- `ZAI_API_KEY` (or `ZHIPU_API_KEY`) automatically exposes a `zai` provider route (z.ai GLM chat via `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4`).
- `openrouter` and `requesty` default to OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` routing.
- You can target them by setting `UPSTREAM_PROVIDER_ID=openrouter|requesty|gemini|zai`, or by listing them in `UPSTREAM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER_IDS`.

Additional provider ids:

- `ob1` is available as a standard provider id. Configure it in `keys.json` and target it with `UPSTREAM_PROVIDER_ID=ob1`.
- The default base URL for `ob1` is `https://dashboard.openblocklabs.com/api`.

## Run

Start the API server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Build and run production mode:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Run tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Web Console

Run the web UI in dev mode:

```bash
pnpm web:dev
```

Build the web UI:

```bash
pnpm web:build
```

Preview the built UI:

```bash
pnpm web:preview
```

## Host fleet dashboard

The console now includes a **Hosts** page for the ussy fleet.

What it shows:
- per-host container inventory
- routed subdomains parsed from the runtime Caddyfile
- partial/unreachable host cards instead of failing the whole page when one host is broken

How it works:
- the local proxx container can read Docker state through an opt-in mounted Docker socket
- the local proxx container can read runtime files from an opt-in read-only runtime bind mount
- remote hosts are queried over HTTPS through each host's own `/api/ui/hosts/self` endpoint

Minimal env shape:

```bash
HOST_DASHBOARD_SELF_ID=ussy
HOST_DASHBOARD_TARGETS_JSON=[{"id":"ussy","label":"ussy.promethean.rest","baseUrl":"https://ussy.promethean.rest","authTokenEnv":"HOST_DASHBOARD_USSY_TOKEN"},{"id":"ussy3","label":"ussy3.promethean.rest","baseUrl":"https://ussy3.promethean.rest","authTokenEnv":"HOST_DASHBOARD_USSY3_TOKEN"}]
HOST_DASHBOARD_USSY_TOKEN=...
HOST_DASHBOARD_USSY3_TOKEN=...
```

Notes:
- remote targets need an explicit `authToken` or `authTokenEnv`; the dashboard does not forward `PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN` implicitly
- if a remote host is unreachable, misconfigured, or missing auth, it still renders as an error card so you can keep future hosts in the inventory before access is fixed
- local Docker/runtime introspection is opt-in via `docker-compose.host-dashboard.override.yml`

## Docker Compose

Container/runtime workflows now live in the workspace devops home:

```bash
cd /path/to/workspace/services/proxx
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f
```

Or from the workspace root:

```bash
pnpm docker:stack status open-hax-openai-proxy
pnpm docker:stack use-container open-hax-openai-proxy -- --build
pnpm docker:stack logs open-hax-openai-proxy -- -f
```

Notes:

- credentials are required for upstream proxying, but they can come from `keys.json`, inline JSON env, provider-specific env vars, or SQL when `DATABASE_URL` is configured
- `data/` still stores local fallback request logs and session history; with `DATABASE_URL` configured, shared fleet analytics are also mirrored into SQL
- The API defaults to `127.0.0.1:8789`
- The web companion is exposed on `${PROXY_WEB_PORT:-5174}`
- The local compose stack now starts Postgres by default and sets `DATABASE_URL` so local runtime behavior matches Render more closely
- `keys.json` is still required for startup.
- `data/` stays bind-mounted for request logs and session history.
- include `docker-compose.host-dashboard.override.yml` only when you want local host-dashboard Docker/runtime introspection
- If you want to mount Factory CLI auth files, include `docker-compose.factory-auth.override.yml` explicitly.
- The compose stack now defaults `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to `http://ollama:11434` when attached to the shared `ai-infra` network; `CHROMA_URL` still defaults to `host.docker.internal` unless you also containerize Chroma on a shared network.
- The web companion is exposed on `${PROXY_WEB_PORT:-5174}`.
- The checked-in host PM2 source now includes both the API and web companion in `ecosystem.container.config.cjs`.
- Source code remains here in `orgs/open-hax/proxx`; service-local env/config/data now lives under `services/proxx`.
- OTEL export can be enabled with standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, and `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variables.

## Chroma + Ollama

Semantic session search now registers an Ollama embedding function with the Chroma JS client instead of relying on Chroma's default embedder.

- Start Chroma separately at `CHROMA_URL`.
- Ensure Ollama is running at `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`.
- Pull an embedding model such as `nomic-embed-text:latest`.

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest
```

The proxy will use Ollama's `/api/embed` endpoint when available, and fall back to `/api/embeddings` for older Ollama builds.

## `keys.json` Format

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "vivgrid": [
      "vivgrid-key-1",
      "vivgrid-key-2"
    ],
    "ollama-cloud": [
      "ollama-key-1",
      "ollama-key-2"
    ],
    "openai": {
      "auth": "oauth_bearer",
      "accounts": [
        "oauth-access-token-1",
        "oauth-access-token-2"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`id` fields are optional. When omitted, the proxy auto-generates stable internal UUID account IDs per token.

Backward compatibility is preserved for legacy single-provider formats:

- `{"keys": ["legacy-key-1", "legacy-key-2"]}`
- `["legacy-key-1", "legacy-key-2"]`

Those legacy formats map to `UPSTREAM_PROVIDER_ID`.

## `models.json` Preferences

`models.json` is now **preference metadata**, not the source of truth. The proxy discovers models dynamically via provider `/v1/models` (and provider-specific catalog endpoints) and uses `models.json` to:

- **prioritize** models in listings and routing
- **disable** models (exclude from listing + routing)
- **alias** model names (rewrite to a discovered model ID)

Example:

```json
{
  "preferred": ["gpt-5.3-codex", "gemini-3.1-pro-preview"],
  "disabled": ["gemini-1.0-pro"],
  "aliases": { "qwen3.5": "qwen3.5:397b" }
}
```

Notes:
- Preferred models only **reorder** discovered models (they do **not** add undiscovered models).
- Disabled models are excluded even if a provider advertises them.
- Aliases only apply when the **target** model exists in the discovered catalog.

## OpenAI OAuth Routing Through Chat-Completions

Route requests to OpenAI by prefixing model names:

- `"model": "openai/gpt-5"`
- `"model": "openai:gpt-5"`

The prefix is stripped before upstream dispatch, and accounts are selected from `keys.json.providers[OPENAI_PROVIDER_ID]`.

For migrated legacy OAuth accounts, the `openai` provider is treated as a ChatGPT Codex upstream, not the OpenAI Platform API. Those accounts require `chatgpt_account_id` metadata and are sent to `/codex/responses` by default.

## Factory.ai Provider

The proxy supports [Factory.ai](https://factory.ai) as a provider, routing requests to `https://api.factory.ai` with automatic credential management.

### Credentials

Factory credentials can be supplied in three ways (all sources merge at runtime):

1. **Environment variable** — set `FACTORY_API_KEY` with your Factory API key.
2. **Local auth files** — the proxy reads `~/.factory/auth.v2.file` and `~/.factory/auth.v2.key` (OAuth tokens written by the Factory CLI). Override paths with `FACTORY_AUTH_V2_FILE` / `FACTORY_AUTH_V2_KEY`.
3. **`keys.json`** — add a `factory` provider entry with `"auth": "api_key"` and an `"accounts"` array containing your key(s). See `keys.example.json` for a complete example including OAuth bearer accounts.

### Model Routing

Prefix a model name with `factory/` or `factory:` to route it through the Factory provider:

- `"model": "factory/claude-opus-4-5"`
- `"model": "factory/gpt-5"`
- `"model": "factory/gemini-3-pro-preview"`

The prefix is stripped before the request is sent upstream. Any model available on Factory.ai can be used.

### OAuth Setup (Web Console)

The web console exposes two OAuth flows for obtaining Factory credentials interactively:

- **Device flow** — `POST /api/ui/credentials/factory/oauth/device/start` initiates a device-code grant; poll with `POST /api/ui/credentials/factory/oauth/device/poll`.
- **Browser flow** — `POST /api/ui/credentials/factory/oauth/browser/start` returns an authorization URL for PKCE-based browser login.

Both flows store the resulting tokens so the proxy can use them for subsequent requests.

### Environment Variables

- `FACTORY_API_KEY` — Factory API key (creates a `factory` provider automatically).
- `FACTORY_BASE_URL` — override the default `https://api.factory.ai` endpoint.
- `FACTORY_MODEL_PREFIXES` — model prefixes that trigger Factory routing (default: `factory/,factory:`).

## Ollama `num_ctx` Control Through OpenAI API

When you send requests through `POST /v1/chat/completions`, route to Ollama by prefixing the model:

- `"model": "ollama/llama3.2"`
- `"model": "ollama:llama3.2"`

Then set `num_ctx` through your OpenAI-style payload using either of these fields:

- `open_hax.ollama.num_ctx` (recommended)
- `num_ctx` (top-level alias)

Example:

```json
{
  "model": "ollama/llama3.2",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Summarize this repository."
    }
  ],
  "open_hax": {
    "ollama": {
      "num_ctx": 32768
    }
  }
}
```

## Side-by-Side Rollout

- Keep VivGrid proxy on `8787` and run this proxy on `8789` for parallel validation.
- Reuse the same keys/models files initially, then split once traffic migrates.
- Compare status codes, SSE behavior, and tool-call payloads before cutover.

## Example Request

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8789/v1/chat/completions \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer change-me-open-hax-proxy-token' \
  --data '{
    "model": "gemini-3.1-pro-preview",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Say hello in English, Chinese and Japanese."
      }
    ],
    "stream": true
  }'
```
