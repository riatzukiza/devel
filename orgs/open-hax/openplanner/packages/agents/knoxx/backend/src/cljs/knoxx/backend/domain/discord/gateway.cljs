  "Discord gateway manager — native CLJS implementation using discord.js.

   Uses direct discord.js import via shadow-cljs :keep-as-import.
   The :keep-as-import #{\"discord.js\"} in shadow-cljs.edn tells shadow-cljs
   to skip dependency analysis for discord.js, generating a bare import statement.
   Node.js resolves transitive Node.js built-in deps (events, buffer, etc.) at runtime.

   Exported: createDiscordGatewayManager — factory function returning a JS object
   with async methods. Also provides a CLJS convenience API via set-manager!."
