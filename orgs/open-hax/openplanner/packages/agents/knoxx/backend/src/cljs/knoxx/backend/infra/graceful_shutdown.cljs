  "Graceful shutdown orchestration for PM2/system restarts.

   Goals:
   - stop accepting new work quickly
   - allow inflight HTTP requests and active turns a bounded window to settle
   - persist any still-running sessions into a resumable Redis state
   - release timers/sockets so PM2 can restart cleanly"
