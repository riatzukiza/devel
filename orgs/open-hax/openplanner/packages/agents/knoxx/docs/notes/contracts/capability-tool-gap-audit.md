I need you to review the knoxx backend/contracts/capabilities/*.edn files and compare them to the backend/src/cljs/backend/ tools implementations. We are missing a few tools that are used by the defined capability contracts.

the agent should be able to render messages and audio.
The agent should be able to see and "hear" audio, if the model contract specifies the model has those abilities
The agent should be able to render spectrograms, so a vision model can still do audio work with me

And I want a special agent I can run for doing artistic work with music and stuff.
git@github.com:mojomast/shoedelussy.git
we need an instance of this MCP server running.
Add it to the pm2 ecosystem file, and write capabilities for it to assign to the creative bot.
