the agent contracts are no longer suposed to have those fields.

they should not know about the mechanism that trigger them, they don't care about that.

no source,  no trigger, no hooks, no cadance.

Fields on an agent contrct should only be answer the questions:
What can this agent do?
What can this agent *not* do?
What model can it run?
What system prompts are used?


so we need to remove any references to:
:cadence-min
:source-kind
:trigger-kind
:sources
:source-mode
:hooks
:task


The task prompt is an artifact of the depreciated `event-agent` concept.

These agent contracts shouldn't care about the specific task.

The agent contract establish a context under which an agent is invoked

The task prompt is contruction from the context that invoked it, not from with in the agent
contract
