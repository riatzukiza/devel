I'm thinking I need 3 seperate agents for the next phase, and for each of the 3 views to have seperate session lists.
the chat view, the CMS, and the translation view, each need to work slightly differently but fundementally work on the same machinery

mainly we need to isolate the different sessions for diferent types of work so translation runs do not pollute your agent or content editor sessions.

I think that the cms agents might benefit from being bound to the document(s) you're editing?
Or maybe it should be like workspaces instead?

The session model gives us the initial seperation logic.

But it's always been something that bothered me in other agent tools.

you make a session, to eventually need to start a new one.

you accumulate this history of sessions
You eventually need to go back to *ONE* of them, but most sessions you don't.

So you've got this huge list of sessions with ambiguous names
the names end up tightly coupled to your initial request.

but work has a tendency to drift away from the original context.
Here’s a tighter, more client-ready version. I leaned into the same core positioning that shows up in your internal Knoxx notes—Knoxx as the reusable knowledge shell/product shell over the underlying data and retrieval stack—while cutting jargon and making the business case more legible for a buyer-facing demo.
