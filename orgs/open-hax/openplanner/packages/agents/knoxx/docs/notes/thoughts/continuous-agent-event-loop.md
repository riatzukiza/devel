# Continuous agent spec
Using steers to talk to the voice agent is just no good.
The system needs to be in a continuous loop.
It needs tools to actively read the transcripts.
When a turn ends, it needs the most recent transcripts given to it as a user prompt, basicly like
synthesis mode, except the event that is being listened to is
  "this conversation/session turn ended and is ready to take a prompt"

So we need a new event type for this...
well, I think eta-mu sdk should provide this?
We added an "idle" event.

Not sure if the version we are using has had it updated...

we need to publish the latest eta-mu now that it's basicly stable.

we've really gotta get events more completely seperated from agents...

it'd be nice to trigger any kind of job on an event.
