1. The agents dropdown on the chat page is not showing agents any more
2. Agents are suposed to get their tools from the capabilities contracts, groups of tools used frequently together
3. While agents should be allowed to have individual capabilities defined for them,
   the prefered way of assigning capabilities should be through roles.
4. The system admin should have an actor, with a role
5. human and agent actors are both able to have the same kinds of roles.
6. Tools in the system should all loosely coorespond with a related capability in the user interface
7. Each actor should be assigned a default actor

## examples senarios of actor/agent relationships

the translation agent, that's a distinct actor with a set of base tools, and each languge they are translating is a specific agent.
all of the discord agents, they are owned/run by one discord actor who has the core set of discord tools,
the primary chat interface has a specific actor, and the drop down lets you select an agent for that actor to act under.
the CMS chat interface, has a specific actor with it's base set of tools, and it also has a set of agents that it could run as.
The contract chat agent has it's own actor, set of base tools base prompts, and additional agent roles it can act under

 :prompts          {:system "..." ;;:task "..."
 }
 ;; :data             {:filters {:channels [] :keywords []}} ;; this stuff also, doesn't belong on this  contract. We figure  these out from the call site. Probably a trigger that runs a start agent session action
 }
