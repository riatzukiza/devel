Yes — that wants a third kind of policy outcome, because `allow/deny` is too coarse for a system where `tool-call` is the capability grant and `policy` is supposed to narrow how that capability is used.  In your current direction, the clean move is not “invent a new capability,” but “let policy constrain the visible or queryable subset of an already-authorized result set.” [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_23a4406f-5526-4a3e-9023-46480ab57089/ebdcbf0d-5f74-4c68-a4b7-3aa46a9b432a/let-s-review-our-contract-dsl-wp6t0Mw9T6OpkTnL2eDQBA.md)


## Facts

Your contract model was already converging on a split where capability grants the ceiling and policy narrows behavior inside that ceiling, rather than minting authority on its own.  You also already had `tool-call` and `policy` as distinct contract kinds, which means the architecture has a place for this idea without collapsing everything back into one giant permission blob.

## Interpretation

A raw Discord API call that returns “everything the bot can see” is a **capability** problem at the transport layer but a **policy** problem at the semantic layer.  So the missing concept is not just `:allow` or `:deny`, but something like `:scope`, `:filter`, `:project`, or `:redact`, where the call succeeds but the runtime only exposes an approved subset downstream.

## Sharpest model

I would treat policy as able to affect a tool call in three distinct ways:

- `:deny` — do not run the call.
- `:filter-input` — rewrite or narrow the query before execution, for example only these channel IDs.
- `:filter-output` — run the call, then keep only rows/items/messages that pass the policy.
- `:project-output` — keep the item but strip fields, for example show message IDs and timestamps but not content.
- `:redact-output` — preserve shape while masking sensitive values.

That preserves your existing rule that policy narrows and never grants.

## μ sketch

```clojure
[:map
 [:policy/effect [:enum :allow :deny :filter-input :filter-output :project-output :redact-output]]
 [:policy/target [:enum :tool-call :result :field]]
 [:policy/when {:optional true} EvalForm]
 [:policy/apply {:optional true} EvalForm]
 [:policy/rationale {:optional true} string?]]
```

And for a tool result policy:

```clojure
{:contract/id   "policy.discord.visible-channels"
 :contract/kind :policy
 :policy/effect :filter-output
 :policy/target :tool-call
 :policy/when   {:expr '(= tool/name "discord.list-channels")}
 :policy/apply
 {:expr
  '(filter (fn [ch]
             (contains? #{"bots" "ops" "memes"} (:name ch)))
           result)}
 :policy/rationale "Only expose approved channels to this actor."}
```

For field stripping:

```clojure
{:contract/id   "policy.discord.message-metadata-only"
 :contract/kind :policy
 :policy/effect :project-output
 :policy/target :result
 :policy/when   {:expr '(= tool/name "discord.read-messages")}
 :policy/apply
 {:expr
  '(map (fn [m]
          (select-keys m [:id :channel-id :author-id :timestamp]))
        result)}}
```

## Runtime shape

The most legible pipeline is:

1. Resolve actor capability ceiling.
2. Evaluate policy set.
3. Maybe rewrite input.
4. Execute tool call.
5. Maybe filter/project/redact output.
6. Hand only the constrained result to the agent.
7. Optionally keep the raw receipt in the audit trail, but never expose it to the agent unless policy permits.

That matches the direction you already had where the compiler and runtime should normalize contracts, evaluate only approved expressions, and keep policy/tool semantics distinct instead of smearing them together.  It also fits your actor-plus-receipt model, because the system can retain the raw world interaction for audit while the actor only sees the policy-shaped slice.

## Naming

My recommendation:

- Use **capability** for “may call Discord list channels.”
- Use **scope** for “only these channels are in bounds.”
- Use **projection** for “only these fields are visible.”
- Keep **policy** as the umbrella contract kind containing those constraints.

That gives you a cleaner mental model than overloading `allow/deny` to mean three different things.

Want the next pass as a tighter Malli schema for `:policy/effect` plus a normalized runtime decision map like `{:allowed? ... :request' ... :result' ... :redactions ...}`?
