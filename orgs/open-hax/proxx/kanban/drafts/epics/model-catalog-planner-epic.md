# Epic: Model Catalog Planner v1

**Status:** Draft
**Epic SP:** 22 (8 sub-specs ≤5 SP each)
**Priority:** P0
**Audit ref:** `specs/audits/2026-04-02-ad-hoc-routing-code-audit.md` Findings 2, 3
**Depends on:** `model-family-registry.md` (3 SP), `routing-pipeline-extraction.md` (3 SP remaining), `dead-code-model-routing-cleanup.md` (1 SP)
**Supersedes:** `dynamic-provider-model-discovery.md` (this epic absorbs its routing-architecture layer; the discovery/store layer remains authoritative there)
**Dependent SP (not counted below):** 7 SP across dependency specs

## Mission

Replace the hot-path fallback loop with **catalog-gated model-family/provider strategies**. No provider is ever attempted for a model it cannot serve. The word "fallback" survives only at API-compatibility alias boundaries, never inside the execution core.

## Problem statement

The current routing hot path lives in `src/lib/provider-strategy/fallback/legacy.ts` (1263 lines) and its twin `src/lib/provider-strategy.ts` (3126 lines). Both implement a **fallback execution model**: iterate providers in priority order, attempt each, retry or advance on failure. This has three architectural flaws:

1. **No admission gate.** The loop attempts providers regardless of whether they can serve the requested model. This produces unsupported-provider hammering, 404/422 spam, and wasted latency budgets.
2. **Fallback is the execution model.** "Upstream → fallback" is not a routing preference — it is the entire control flow. The spec in `dynamic-provider-model-discovery.md` already says upstream/fallback should be removed as a top-level concept and replaced with suitability scoring.
3. **Dual authority.** `provider-strategy.ts` and the split `provider-strategy/*` modules export overlapping strategy classes, `selectProviderStrategy` functions, and execution paths. This duplication is the single biggest tech-debt amplifier in the repo.

## Invariants

1. **No provider is ever attempted for a model it cannot serve.** The `ModelCatalog.canServe()` gate is mandatory before any upstream fetch.
2. **Family inference has exactly one authority.** All consumers import from `ModelFamilyRegistry`. No other module defines prefix lists or family heuristics.
3. **Compatibility aliases live only at API boundaries.** `ModelNameAliases` applies at request parsing time. No alias logic inside `RoutingPlanner`, `AttemptExecutor`, or `ProviderAdapter`.
4. **The word "fallback" does not appear in execution-core module names or types.** It may appear in API-compat re-exports and documentation referencing the migration.
5. **Provider adapters don't route.** `ProviderAdapter` translates requests/responses. Routing decisions belong to `ModelStrategy` + `RoutingPlanner`.
6. **The monolith (`provider-strategy.ts`) and the split modules (`provider-strategy/*`) must not coexist as authorities.** After sub-spec 7, only the new architecture survives.

## Countermoves

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Catalog is stale → false negative → model rejected | Stale providers remain in catalog with `stale: true` flag; planner includes stale providers with a score penalty, not exclusion |
| New provider added → not in catalog → can't serve | Catalog refresh interval is tunable; manual refresh endpoint for ops |
| Strategy returns empty eligible set for a valid model | OpenSourceModelStrategy acts as catch-all: any provider that the catalog admits for an unrecognized family is eligible |
| Migration breaks existing behavior | Sub-spec 1 starts with pass-through (logs but doesn't gate); sub-spec 7 uses feature flag for parallel run before cutover |
| Scorer has no data for new provider+model | Cold-start: scorer returns neutral score; ranking falls back to preference overlay order |

## Definition of done

- [ ] `ModelCatalog.canServe()` gates all routing attempts
- [ ] No provider is attempted for a model it cannot serve (verified by integration test)
- [ ] `ModelFamilyRegistry` is the sole authority for family inference (verified by `rg`)
- [ ] `src/lib/provider-strategy/fallback/legacy.ts` deleted
- [ ] `src/lib/provider-strategy.ts` deleted
- [ ] `chat.ts` < 350 lines, `responses.ts` < 300 lines, `images.ts` < 150 lines
- [ ] Catalog fetched exactly once per request
- [ ] All 162 proxy tests pass
- [ ] No `isRecord`, `asString`, `asNumber`, `toSafeLimit` helper duplication across modules (single source each)
