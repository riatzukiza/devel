# Spec: App Modularization

**Status:** OBSOLETE — superseded by `specs/drafts/control-plane-mvc-transition-roadmap.md` and `specs/drafts/control-plane-api-contract-v1.md`

## Historical Reference
Original goal: Split `src/app.ts` from 2337 lines into routes/, handlers/, middleware/.

## Resolution
The MVC transition roadmap and control-plane contract spec achieved the same goals through a different approach:
- Route modules extracted to `src/routes/`
- `registerApiV1Routes` for canonical control-plane routes
- `ui-routes.ts` deleted entirely
- `app.ts` reduced from 1025 → 896 lines

See `specs/drafts/control-plane-mvc-transition-roadmap.md` for the authoritative roadmap.
