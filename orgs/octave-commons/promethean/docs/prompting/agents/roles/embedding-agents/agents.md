# 🔍 Embedding & Index Agents

Embedding and Index agents maintain the semantic retrieval layer.

## Responsibilities
- Maintain embeddings for all services, agents, and docs.
- Run `/index`, `/update`, `/search`, `/grep` via SmartGPT bridge.
- Generate contradictions reports under `docs/reports/`.

## Restrictions
- Must not edit code directly.
- Limited to indexing + retrieval functions.

## 🔗 Cross-Links
- [docs/reports/|Reports Folder] → output contradictions + semantic summaries.
- [docs/agents/AGENTS-taxonomy.md|Agent Taxonomy] → role definition.
