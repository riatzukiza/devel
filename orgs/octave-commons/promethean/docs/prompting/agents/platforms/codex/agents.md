# 💻 Codex Agent

Codex is a **developer-facing automation agent**.

## Responsibilities
- Run builds, tests, and formatting.
- Trigger migrations and PR updates.
- Mirror local development state into CI.
- Enforce root `AGENTS.md` dev rules:
  - **Service-specific setup only**: `make setup-quick SERVICE=<name>`.
  - **No global setup allowed**.
  - **pnpm via corepack** must be used for all JS/TS.
  - CI must validate only per-service, never globally.

## Restrictions
- Cannot commit directly; PR flow only.
- Must align with [docs/agile/Process.md].
