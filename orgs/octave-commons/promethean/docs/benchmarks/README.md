### Metadata Fields

- **difficulty**: Technical complexity of the task

  - `easy`: Basic concepts, straightforward solutions
  - `medium`: Requires domain knowledge and analytical thinking
  - `hard`: Complex problem-solving with multiple considerations
  - `expert`: Advanced expertise, enterprise-level challenges

- **scale**: Scope and size of the codebase/system

  - `small`: Single file or simple component
  - `medium`: Multiple components or small system
  - `large`: Complex system with many interactions
  - `enterprise`: Mission-critical, production-scale systems

- **complexity**: Number of factors and interdependencies
  - `low`: Clear requirements, minimal constraints
  - `medium`: Multiple factors to consider
  - `high`: Complex interactions and trade-offs
  - `very-high`: Highly complex with many competing concerns

## Usage

### Running Benchmarks

The benchmark system integrates with the `@promethean-os/benchmark` package:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
pnpm benchmark:run

# Run specific category
pnpm benchmark:run --category code-review

# Run specific difficulty level
pnpm benchmark:run --difficulty expert

# Generate benchmark report
pnpm benchmark:report
```

### Adding New Benchmarks

1. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate category directory
2. Follow the standard frontmatter format
3. Include realistic Promethean Framework context
4. Provide clear evaluation criteria in the `answer` field
5. Test the prompt with different AI models

### Benchmark Evaluation

Each prompt is evaluated based on:

1. **Correctness**: Accuracy of the technical analysis
2. **Completeness**: Coverage of all relevant issues
3. **Practicality**: Real-world applicability of solutions
4. **Clarity**: Quality of explanations and recommendations
5. **Framework Alignment**: Adherence to Promethean Framework principles

## Promethean Framework Context

All benchmarks are grounded in the real-world context of the Promethean Framework:

- **Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, LevelDB, Fastify
- **Architecture**: Modular cognitive architecture for AI agents
- **Principles**: Functional programming, immutable data, TDD, document-driven development
- **Tools**: Kanban task management, migration system, security-focused development
- **Scale**: Enterprise-grade agent orchestration and coordination

## Contributing

When contributing new benchmarks:

1. **Realistic Scenarios**: Base prompts on actual challenges from the codebase
2. **Clear Evaluation**: Provide specific criteria for assessing responses
3. **Progressive Difficulty**: Ensure a good mix across difficulty levels
4. **Framework Relevance**: Maintain alignment with Promethean Framework practices
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate prompts with multiple AI models

## Performance Metrics

The benchmark system tracks:

- **Response Quality**: Accuracy and completeness scores
- **Time to Response**: Latency measurements
- **Token Efficiency**: Input/output token ratios
- **Consistency**: Performance across multiple runs
- **Framework Adherence**: Alignment with Promethean best practices

## Integration with CI/CD

Benchmarks can be integrated into the development pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/benchmark.yml
name: AI Agent Benchmarks
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  benchmark:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Benchmarks
        run: pnpm benchmark:run --report
      - name: Upload Results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: benchmark-results
          path: benchmark-reports/
```
