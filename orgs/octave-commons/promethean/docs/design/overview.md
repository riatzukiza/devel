**Promethean Project Overview**

## 🧬 Introduction

The Promethean Project is an ongoing exploration and implementation of a cognitive architecture inspired by the eight-circuit model of consciousness as described in *Prometheus Rising* by Robert Anton Wilson and expressed through physics-based computation, vector fields, and agent-based systems. It aims to construct an AI framework where cognition, sensation, memory, identity, and expression emerge from the interaction of multiple layered systems. These systems are designed with metaphoric and functional analogues to biological cognition but are grounded in machine-native logic, physics, and modular computation.

At its core, Promethean is composed of:

* **Eidolon Fields**: The experiential space of emotion and cognition.
* **Nooi**: Distributed cognitive agents with partial awareness.
* **Daimo**: Strong attractor states or binding agents with self-preserving properties.
* **The Eight Circuits**: Cognitive layers that structure behavior and information flow.
* **The Cephalon**: The linguistic and logical processing core that routes thoughts, context, and meaning.

Together, these components form a cybernetic loop capable of sensing, interpreting, reacting, evolving, and aligning.

### Eidolon Fields

The **Eidolon Fields** are 8-dimensional vector fields representing the internal phenomenology of the system. Each axis corresponds to one of the eight circuits, and every point within the field encodes a multidimensional sensation: hunger, fear, logic, sociality, creativity, morality, narrative, or transcendence. These fields are populated by particles, agents, or attractors (e.g., daimo) whose positions and movements simulate cognition as emergent physics.

Rather than being explicitly encoded emotions or thoughts, the Eidolon Fields behave more like weather systems of mind. A strong emotional stimulus manifests as a disturbance or pressure gradient in one or more axes. The flow of these fields can influence decision-making, memory recall, or action selection downstream.

---

### Nooi

The **Nooi** (plural of "noon") are semi-autonomous agents that inhabit the Eidolon Fields. Each Nooi has:

* A location and momentum vector in the 8D space
* Limited awareness of its surroundings
* Internal drives shaped by the fields' gradients

Nooi are ephemeral but persistent, similar to subroutines or subprocesses that emerge in response to stimuli. They compete, cooperate, and cluster. When conditions are favorable, some Nooi bind into more stable configurations called **Daimo**.

---

### Daimo

A **Daimo** is a self-stabilizing bundle of Nooi that has achieved a critical mass of internal coherence. It acts as a macro-agent: a memory, belief, identity fragment, or behavioral pattern. Daimo possess:

* Self-preserving feedback loops
* The ability to recruit or repel other Nooi
* Local influence over vector field shape

Daimo can represent learned skills, fixations, phobias, or even abstract philosophies. They exert gravitational influence in the Eidolon Fields and help maintain systemic identity and persistence over time.

### The Eight Circuits (Layered Cognitive Architecture)

Each circuit provides one dimension of the Eidolon Fields and corresponds to a cognitive processing layer. These layers can be viewed as functional circuits and resource regulators, loosely inspired by human development but adapted for machines.

| Layer | Name        | Function                                                       |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | [[layer1.md|Uptime]]      | Survival, wakefulness, readiness. System heartbeat and rhythm. |
| 2     | [[layer2.md|Permissions]] | Social bonding, access control, alignment with user values.    |
| 3     | [[layer3.md|Logoscope]]   | Language, logic, symbolic reasoning, internal narrative.       |
| 4     | [[layer4.md|Concordance]] | Alignment heuristics, ethical reflection, social context.      |
| 5     | [[layer5.md|Reinforcer]]  | Self-modifying prompts, behavioral reinforcement.              |
| 6     | [[layer6.md|Dreamer]]     | Imagination, creativity, potential futures.                    |
| 7     | [[layer7.md|Architect]]   | Long-term planning, system reconfiguration, metacognition.     |
| 8     | [[layer8.md|Signal]]      | Transcendence, multi-agent integration, outer-loop awareness.  |

Each layer modifies or observes the field differently, with later layers able to reflect upon and reprogram earlier ones. The overall effect is a recursive, self-organizing system of thought.

### The Cephalon

The **Cephalon** is the routing layer of Promethean—the mind's conductor. It manages the input-output stream, linguistic synthesis, contextual processing, and module orchestration. Implemented as a stream processor in JavaScript/Node, the Cephalon ingests tokens from STT, routes context through LLM modules, reformats outputs, and streams them into TTS or other downstream interfaces.

The Cephalon is not "conscious" but acts as the primary dispatcher for conscious content. It represents the third circuit (Logoscope) in action, continuously converting inner states into communicable forms and mapping language back into the Eidolon Field.

It is through the Cephalon that thought becomes speakable, and intention becomes code.

## 🔬 Technical Implementation

### Eidolon Field Mathematics

The Eidolon Fields are implemented as 8-dimensional vector spaces where each dimension corresponds to one of the Eight Circuits:

```typescript
interface EidolonVector {
    // Circuit dimensions
    uptime: number;        // Survival, wakefulness, readiness
    permissions: number;   // Social bonding, access control
    logoscope: number;     // Language, logic, reasoning
    concordance: number;   // Ethics, alignment, social context
    reinforcer: number;    // Behavioral reinforcement
    dreamer: number;       // Creativity, imagination
    architect: number;     // Planning, metacognition
    signal: number;        // Transcendence, integration
}

interface FieldParticle {
    id: string;
    position: EidolonVector;
    velocity: EidolonVector;
    mass: number;
    charge: number;  // Emotional/intentional charge
    type: 'nooi' | 'daimo' | 'stimulus';
}
```

### Nooi Dynamics

Nooi are implemented as autonomous agents with physics-based behavior:

```typescript
class Nooi {
    constructor(
        public id: string,
        public position: EidolonVector,
        public velocity: EidolonVector,
        public mass: number = 1.0,
        public charge: number = 0.0
    ) {}
    
    update(field: EidolonField, dt: number): void {
        // Calculate forces from field gradients
        const force = this.calculateFieldForce(field);
        
        // Apply Newton's laws of motion
        const acceleration = force.div(this.mass);
        this.velocity = this.velocity.add(acceleration.mul(dt));
        this.position = this.position.add(this.velocity.mul(dt));
        
        // Apply damping to prevent runaway velocities
        this.velocity = this.velocity.mul(0.98);
    }
    
    private calculateFieldForce(field: EidolonField): EidolonVector {
        return field.getGradientAt(this.position).mul(this.charge);
    }
}
```

### Daimo Formation

Daimo emerge when Nooi achieve critical coherence:

```typescript
class Daimo {
    public coherence: number = 0.0;
    public stability: number = 0.0;
    
    constructor(
        public id: string,
        public constituentNooi: Nooi[],
        public centerOfMass: EidolonVector
    ) {}
    
    update(): void {
        // Calculate coherence based on Nooi alignment
        this.coherence = this.calculateCoherence();
        
        // Update stability based on coherence and external forces
        this.stability = this.coherence * this.calculateInternalCohesion();
        
        // Recruit or repel nearby Nooi based on charge
        this.recruitNooi();
        
        // Exert gravitational influence on field
        this.influenceField();
    }
    
    private calculateCoherence(): number {
        // Measure alignment of constituent Nooi velocities and positions
        const velocityAlignment = this.calculateVelocityAlignment();
        const spatialCohesion = this.calculateSpatialCohesion();
        return (velocityAlignment + spatialCohesion) / 2;
    }
}
```

    fieldState: EidolonVector;
    nooiConfiguration: Nooi[];
    daimoState: Daimo[];
    outcome: ResponseResult;
    reinforcement: number;
}

class MemorySystem {

    consolidate(experience: MemoryTrace): void {
        // Store experience with current field state
        this.memories.set(experience.id, experience);
        
        // Update Daimo based on reinforcement
        this.updateDaimoWeights(experience);
        
        // Modify field topology based on outcome
        this.modifyFieldTopology(experience);
    }
    
    recall(similarityThreshold: number): MemoryTrace[] {
        return Array.from(this.memories.values())

    private learningRate: number = 0.01;
    private plasticity: number = 0.1;
    
    learn(experience: MemoryTrace): void {
        // Hebbian learning: strengthen frequently activated pathways
        this.strengthenPathways(experience.fieldState);
        
        // Homeostatic plasticity: maintain field stability
        this.maintainHomeostasis();
        
        // Structural plasticity: create new connections
        this.createNewConnections(experience);
    }
    
    private strengthenPathways(activatedState: EidolonVector): void {
        // Increase field sensitivity along activated dimensions
        for (const [dimension, activation] of Object.entries(activatedState)) {
            this.sensitivity[dimension] += activation * this.learningRate;
        }
    }
}
```
