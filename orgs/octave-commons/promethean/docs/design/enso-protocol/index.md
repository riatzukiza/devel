# Enso Protocol Design Set

The Enso Protocol ENSO-1 enables rooms of humans and agents to exchange
events, media streams, and shared context with strong guarantees around
causality, privacy, and capability negotiation. This design set replaces the
former `docs/design/enso.md` monolith with focused references that track the
state of the protocol and its supporting packages.

## Conventions

* All TypeScript examples assume native ESM, strict type checking, and
  immutable data handling.
* JSON examples show canonical wire messages. Omitted properties follow the
  relevant schema defaults.
* Mermaid diagrams illustrate message flow and room topology.
* Each document is scoped so it can be used as a standalone reference as well
  as part of this set.

## Human Follow-up Task

*Validate the reorganised protocol docs with the wider team.* Share this bundle
with a human operator to confirm the structure works for their workflows and to
collect any missing requirements before locking the v0.1 draft.
