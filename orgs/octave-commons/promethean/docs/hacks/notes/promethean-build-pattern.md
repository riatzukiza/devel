Short version: put a *thin* `build` script in every package, then drive them from the root using pnpm’s recursive + filters. You keep per-package builds, and the root builds everything (or smart subsets) without duplication.

Here’s the pattern that works and doesn’t fight pnpm.

# 1) Each package owns its local build
```
`packages/foo/package.json`
```
```json
{
  "name": "@promethean-os/foo",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.json"
  }
}
```

Keep this minimal. If you need extra steps (copy files, fix .js extensions, etc.), wrap them in a local `scripts/build.ts` and call it here.

# 2) Root scripts orchestrate

Root `package.json`

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    // build ALL packages in the workspace (in parallel, respecting deps)
    "build": "pnpm -r --workspace-concurrency=4 run build",

    // build a single package by name (pass PKG=@promethean-os/foo)
    "build:pkg": "pnpm -r --filter {PKG} run build",

    // build a package + all of its upstream dependencies
    "build:with-deps": "pnpm -r --filter ...{PKG} run build",

    // build only packages that changed since last commit (cheap heuristic)
    "build:since": "pnpm -r --filter \"...[HEAD^]\" run build",

    // watch everything (if packages expose `watch`)
    "watch": "pnpm -r run watch"
  }
}
```

### Why these matter

* `pnpm -r run build` runs each package’s own `build`, so packages stay independently buildable:
  `pnpm --filter @promethean-os/foo run build`.
* The **ellipsis** rules are non-obvious but critical:

  * `--filter ...@promethean-os/foo` (prefix ellipsis) includes **dependencies** of `foo` (build upstream first).
  * `--filter @promethean-os/foo...` (trailing ellipsis) includes **dependents** of `foo` (downstream).
  * No ellipsis → just that package.

# 3) (Optional but recommended) TypeScript project references

If you enable TS build mode, the root can drive a strictly ordered build without any external tool.

Root `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "files": [],
  "references": [
    { "path": "packages/foo" },
    { "path": "packages/bar" }
  ]
}
```

Package `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": { "composite": true, "declaration": true, "outDir": "dist" },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

Then add at root:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:ts": "tsc -b",
    "clean:ts": "tsc -b --clean"
  }
}
```

You still keep `pnpm --filter @promethean-os/foo run build` working, but `tsc -b` can do the whole graph deterministically when you want a clean, full build.

# 4) Keep duplication out

* Put **tooling** deps at the root `typescript`, `ava`, `@types/node`, linters.
* Use package-level runtime deps only where they’re actually needed.
* Use `pnpm.overrides` at the root to pin versions repo-wide.
* Add a CI check that fails a PR if a leaf re-declares a root-owned tool (we can wire that next).

# 5) Practical commands you’ll actually use

* Build everything fast:

  ```
  pnpm build
  ```
* Build just one package:

  ```
  pnpm --filter @promethean-os/foo run build
  ```
* Build `foo` **and its dependencies** (fixes your earlier “HeadersInit” type errors by ensuring upstream is compiled):

  ```
  pnpm -r --filter ...@promethean-os/foo run build
  ```
* Build packages affected by your last commit (changed or dependents):

  ```
  pnpm -r --filter "...[HEAD^]" run build
  ```

If you want, I’ll add a tiny `@promethean-os/build-tools` helper (ESM, no mutation) that:

* enforces `.js` extensions in `exports` after build,
* copies minimal `package.json` to `dist`,
* and gives you a single `prom-build` you can call from every package to avoid script drift.
