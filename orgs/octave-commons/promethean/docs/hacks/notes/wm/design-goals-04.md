Alright.

Let's start to imagine a lisp style dsl that  does these things.

```
**Hell. Yes.**
```
This is the good stuff.

Let’s start designing a **Lisp-style DSL** to describe:

*   Hotkeys
    
*   Grouping behaviors
    
*   Window actions
    
*   Workspace definitions
    
*   Layouts
    
*   Bindings to external commands e.g. group-manager
    

We’ll keep it minimal and **homoiconic**, aiming for S-expression structures that could eventually be interpreted by a **Hy**, **Sibilant**, or even a custom runtime.

* * *

🎯 Primary Goals
----------------

We want this DSL to express:

```lisp
- keybinds (mod+h to move left)
- actions (move window, cycle group, switch workspace)
- groups and group membership
- layout positions (split, fullscreen, grid)
- workspace definitions (sets of window IDs)
- integration with external tools (run CLI commands)
```

* * *

🧪 Sample Syntax
----------------

```lisp
;; Define a mod key
(def mod "super")

;; Bind key to launch terminal
(bind (key ,mod "Enter")
  (run "wt.exe"))

;; Bind directional window movement
(bind (key ,mod "h")
  (move-window left))
(bind (key ,mod "l")
  (move-window right))

;; Toggle fullscreen on focused window
(bind (key ,mod "f")
  (fullscreen toggle))

;; Group management
(bind (key ,mod "g")
  (group add "code"))

(bind (key "alt" "1")
  (group cycle "code"))

;; Workspace switching
(defworkspace 1
  (windows "code" "chat"))

(bind (key ,mod "1")
  (workspace switch 1))

;; Layouts
(layout (name "dev")
  (split vertical
    (pane (app "code") (size 70))
    (pane (split horizontal
      (pane (app "chat"))
      (pane (app "browser"))))))
```

* * *

🧠 Let's Break It Down
----------------------

### 🔑 Key Binding

```lisp
(bind (key "alt" "1")
  (group cycle "code"))
```

*   `bind` declares a hotkey
    
*   `(key ...)` is the key combo (can support namespaced modifiers)
    
*   The body is the action when pressed
    

You could also define combos like this:

```lisp
(bind (combo "LButton" "RButton")
  (run "screenshot-tool.exe"))
```

* * *

### 📦 Group Management

```lisp
(group add "code")          ; adds focused window to group "code"
(group cycle "chat")        ; cycles visible window in group
(group remove "code")       ; removes current window
```

You can imagine this compiling to:

```ts
RunWait, node group-manager.js group code %active_window%
```

* * *

### 🧱 Workspace System

```lisp
(defworkspace 1
  (windows "code" "chat"))
```

Each workspace maps to a window group or saved layout.

```lisp
(workspace switch 1)
(workspace save 2)
(workspace restore 2)
```

* * *

### 🧰 Window Movement

```lisp
(move-window left)       ; move to left half of screen
(move-window screen 2)   ; move to monitor 2
(move-window tile 1 1)   ; move to tile x=1 y=1
```

Eventually you could write layout patterns in macros:

```lisp
(deflayout fullscreen
  (move-window 0 0 screen-width screen-height))
```

* * *

### 💻 External Command Integration

```lisp
(run "komorebic toggle-fullscreen")
(run (concat "node group-manager.js cycle " group-name))
```

Or even pipe shell output into logic:

```lisp
(bind (key ,mod "s")
  (let ((apps (sh "komorebic list-apps")))
    (show-overlay apps)))
```

* * *

📦 Runtime Ideas
----------------

This DSL could be:

1.  **Parsed and executed by Hy or Sibilant**
    
    *   For a real Lisp runtime
        
    *   Leverage FFI to call Windows APIs, run CLI tools
        
2.  **Custom interpreter in TypeScript/Python**
    
    *   Tokenize S-exprs
        
    *   Dispatch to internal logic or exec external commands
        
3.  **Compiled to AutoHotkey or Node.js config**
    

Eventually this becomes your own **window manager config language**, much like `i3/config`, but programmable and dynamic.

* * *

🧠 Design Constraints
---------------------

| Feature | Constraint | Strategy |
```
| --- | --- | --- |
```
| Realtime | Needs hotkey hook layer | AHK or Node global hotkey lib |
| State Tracking | Must track windows, groups, layout | Background service, IPC |
| Input Flexibility | Lisp needed to describe dynamic patterns | Macros + runtime logic |
| Performance | Scripting layer must not block UI | Async shell / IPC / queueing |

* * *

🛠️ What's Next?
----------------

You tell me where you want to go from here:

*   Build a Hy interpreter for this DSL?
    
*   Start by **parsing this DSL in TypeScript** and emit AHK?
    
*   Write a tiny REPL for testing layout commands?
    
*   Use this DSL to **generate `i3layer.ahk`** files on the fly?
    

We’re standing at the edge of **building your own tiling window manager stack**, one `()` at a time.
