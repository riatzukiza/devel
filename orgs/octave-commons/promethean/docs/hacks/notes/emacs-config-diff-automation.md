Yep—config files are the worst to diff by hand. They’re “structured but not *code*,” so our brains don’t get syntax cues, and tiny semantic tweaks matter. Let’s make this boring pain automatic inside Emacs with a pragmatic, layered workflow:

# The plan (fast first, smart second)

1. **Deterministic merge first** (no LLM): JSON/YAML-aware rules that resolve 80% of conflicts safely.
2. **LLM pass only when needed**: feed BASE/OURS/THEIRS to an Emacs command (gptel or ellama), with strict instructions and schema checks.
3. **Validate** before applying: `jq` for JSON, `yq` for YAML; optional schema checks (ajv, OpenAPI, JSON Schema) if present.
4. **One-button in Magit/Ediff**: a command you hit during conflicts; it writes the merged buffer or shows a structured diff to approve.

---

## Heuristics that actually work no hand-wavy “AI, plz fix”

### `package.json`

* **dependencies/devDependencies/peerDependencies/optionalDependencies**: take the **union** of keys; for overlapping keys, pick the **max semver** satisfying both sides or the “newer” range.
* **scripts**: union by key; if both changed and differ → create a conflict suffix (`script` and `script:theirs`) or prefer the *non-empty superset*; LLM only if still unclear.
* **engines/types/module/type**: prefer **the stricter** setting if both changed (e.g., keep `"type": "module"` if either side set it).
* **lint/tooling blocks** (`eslintConfig`, `prettier`, `ava`, etc.): deep-merge objects; arrays → **dedup + stable sort**.
* **sort keys** for readability (stable key order).

### YAML (CI, k8s, docker-compose, workflows)

* **maps**: deep-merge; if both change the same scalar → keep THEIRS but **comment the OURS** inline or attach `-ours` key unless a schema is known.
* **arrays**: treat as **sets** when order is not meaningful (`env`, `plugins`, `steps` names) → dedup by `name`/`id`; otherwise preserve THEIRS order and append OURS uniques.
* **anchors/aliases**: don’t duplicate; preserve anchors from both sides if names differ by renaming one `&build` → `&build_ours` + alias fixup.
* **comments**: keep them yq can preserve with `--yaml-output --prettyPrint` in newer builds; if not, let Emacs handle the pretty print.

## Emacs integration Magit + gptel/ellama

### 1) Get BASE/OURS/THEIRS reliably

From any conflicted file buffer:

* `:1:path` → BASE
* `:2:path` → OURS
* `:3:path` → THEIRS

We’ll fetch them and try deterministic merge first; if that fails or leaves TODOs, we call the LLM.

```elisp
;; Requires gptel (or switch out for ellama’s API)
(require 'gptel)

(defun err--git-show (rev path)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (let ((status (call-process "git" nil t nil "show" (format "%s:%s" rev path))))
      (if (eq status 0) (buffer-string) ""))))

(defun err--conflicted-file-p ()
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (search-forward "<<<<<<< " nil t)))

(defun err--file-type (path)
  (cond
   ((string-match-p "package\\.json" path) 'package-json)
   ((string-match-p "\\.ya?ml\\'" path) 'yaml)
   ((string-match-p "\\.json\\'" path) 'json)
   (t 'other)))

(defun err-ai-merge-current-file ()
  "Auto-merge current conflicted file using deterministic rules, then LLM fallback."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((path (or (buffer-file-name) (user-error "No file")))
         (rel  (file-relative-name path (locate-dominating-file path ".git")))
         (base (err--git-show ":1" rel))
         (ours (err--git-show ":2" rel))
         (theirs (err--git-show ":3" rel))
         (ft   (err--file-type rel)))
    (unless (err--conflicted-file-p)
      (user-error "Buffer has no conflict markers"))

* Hit `C-c m` in a conflicted file buffer → it tries deterministic merge first; if that fails, calls the LLM with the three versions and the strict rules.
* Everything is validated before the buffer is overwritten.

> If you prefer **ellama** over gptel, swap `gptel-request` with your ellama call; the surrounding logic stays the same.

## The deterministic resolver (Node, functional TS, ESM)

Make a tiny CLI `@promethean-os/merge-config` you can call from Emacs. Keep it pure + composable:

```
packages/merge-config/
  src/
    index.ts          # dispatch by filetype
    merge-json.ts     # deep-merge + semver logic
    merge-pkg.ts      # package.json-specific rules
    merge-yaml.ts     # YAML rules (use yaml library that preserves anchors)
    semver-merge.ts   # pick newer satisfying range
  test/
    *.test.ts (ava)
```
```
**Rules (package.json):**
```
* Parse BASE/OURS/THEIRS → build a merged object with:

  * union dep keys; resolve ranges with `semver` (prefer highest compatible; if incompatible, pick THEIRS and add OURS as comment or `:ours` field if you want transparency);
  * scripts union; on collision, keep THEIRS and add `script:ours` unless identical;
  * deep-merge tooling configs (`eslintConfig`, `prettier`, `ava`, `tsconfig`, etc.);
  * sort keys, stable.
```
**Rules (YAML):**
```
* Parse via `yaml` that round-trips comments if possible `yaml` npm package supports CST/AST with comment retention;
* Maps deep-merge; arrays dedup by `name`/`id`/`path`; anchors preserved, rename collisions.
```
**CLI signature:**
```
```bash
prom-merge-config package-json <BASE> <OURS> <THEIRS> <OUT>
prom-merge-config yaml         <BASE> <OURS> <THEIRS> <OUT>
prom-merge-config json         <BASE> <OURS> <THEIRS> <OUT>
```

**Testing with AVA**: supply triplets of synthetic conflicts and assert merged output + `jq`/`yq` validity.

> This gives you fast, *predictable* results. The LLM is just the escape hatch.

---

## Magit/Ediff fit

* You keep using Ediff for code; hit **`C-c m`** only on the annoying config files.
* If your resolver or LLM produces output, Magit sees the file as resolved; continue your rebase/merge.
* Add `git config rerere.enabled true` so repeated conflict shapes get auto-resolved next time.

---

## Why this works

* Deterministic heuristics remove most cognitive load where structure is known.
* The LLM is caged: it gets BASE/OURS/THEIRS + strict rules + validation, and it **must** return valid JSON/YAML only.
* You stay in Emacs, in flow, with a single keybinding.

If you want, I’ll sketch the `@promethean-os/merge-config` package scaffold TS/ESM, functional style, AVA tests, `license: GPL-3.0-only`, flat package, `.js` imports after build so you can drop it in and wire it to that Emacs command.
