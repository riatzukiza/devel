-# Kanban Board Audit Report

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Total Tasks**: 1,337  
**Audit Status**: ⚠️ **Issues Found**  
**Critical Issues**: 1 status inconsistency, 15 orphaned events

## 🔍 Audit Findings

### ✅ **Fixed Issues**

- **Status Inconsistency**: Heal command task status corrected from `ready` → `breakdown` (auto-fixed)

### ⚠️ **Active Issues**

#### 1. **Orphaned Events (15 tasks)**

**Impact**: Medium - Event log bloat, potential confusion  
**Description**: 15 tasks have events in the log but no corresponding task files  
**Root Cause**: Tasks were deleted (likely moved to icebox and cleaned up) but events remain

**Affected Task UUIDs**:

**Pattern**: All moved from `icebox` → `incoming` → `icebox` on 2025-10-12T02:02-02:03

#### 2. **WIP Limit Management**

**Status**: ✅ **Managed**  
**Action Taken**: Moved 3 P3 tasks from `breakdown` → `icebox` to free capacity  
**Current State**:

- `breakdown`: 10/13 (77% capacity)
- `ready`: 44/55 (80% capacity)

#### 3. **Heal Command Task Status**

**Task**: Implement Kanban Heal Command with Damage Pattern DSL  
**UUID**: a7b8c9d0-e1f2-4a5b-8c9d-0e1f2a3b4c5d  
**Current Status**: `breakdown`  
**Issue**: FSM transition blocked despite meeting criteria  
**Details**:

- ✅ Has complexity estimate: 5 (≤5 required)
- ✅ P1 priority (≤2 required)
- ✅ WIP limits satisfied
- ❌ Transition rule still blocking

### **Task Quality Indicators**

- **Tasks with Estimates**: ~15% (needs improvement)
- **P0/P1 Priority Tasks**: ~8% (good focus)
- **Tasks with tool:_/env:_ tags**: ~25% (needs improvement)

## 🎯 Priority Recommendations

### **Immediate (This Session)**

1. **Clean Orphaned Events**: Implement event cleanup for deleted tasks
2. **Fix FSM Transition**: Debug why heal task transition is blocked
3. **Add Task Estimates**: Improve estimate coverage for better planning

### **Short Term (This Week)**

1. **Implement Heal Command**: The board needs this functionality to auto-detect issues
2. **Improve Task Quality**: Add missing estimates and tags to incoming tasks
3. **WIP Limit Review**: Consider adjusting limits based on team capacity

### **Long Term (This Month)**

1. **Automated Quality Gates**: Prevent low-quality tasks from entering workflow
2. **Event Log Management**: Implement automatic cleanup of orphaned events
3. **Board Health Monitoring**: Regular automated audits with reporting

## 🔧 Technical Issues Identified

### **FSM Transition Logic**

**Problem**: `breakdown-complete?` function should allow transition but doesn't  
**Current Logic**: `(and (has-estimate? task) (<= (get-estimate task) 5))`  
**Task State**: `complexity: 5` should pass  
**Potential Issue**: Type mismatch or estimate parsing problem

### **Event Log Cleanup**

**Problem**: No automatic cleanup when tasks are deleted  
**Impact**: Growing event log with orphaned entries  
**Solution Needed**: Cascade delete or periodic cleanup job

### **Task Quality Gaps**

**Problem**: Many tasks lack required estimates and tags  
**Impact**: Poor planning, blocked transitions  
**Solution Needed**: Quality gates at task creation

## 📋 Action Items

### **For Immediate Implementation**

1. **Debug Heal Task Transition**

   - Investigate FSM rule evaluation
   - Check estimate parsing logic
   - Verify task data structure

2. **Clean Event Log**

   - Remove orphaned events for 16 tasks
   - Implement cleanup automation
   - Add validation for task deletion

3. **Improve Task Quality**
   - Add estimates to high-priority tasks
   - Ensure proper tagging for in_progress transitions
   - Implement quality gates

### **For Heal Command Implementation**

The heal command would have detected and prevented several of these issues:

- **Orphaned Events**: Would tag tasks before deletion
- **Missing Estimates**: Would identify and flag incomplete tasks
- **WIP Violations**: Would provide intelligent task movement suggestions
- **Quality Issues**: Would generate training data for pattern recognition

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### **Board Health Targets**

- **Orphaned Events**: 0 (currently 15)
- **Tasks with Estimates**: >80% (currently ~15%)
- **Tasks with Proper Tags**: >90% for in_progress (currently ~25%)
- **FSM Transition Success Rate**: >95% (currently failing for valid cases)

### **Implementation Priority**

1. **Critical**: Fix FSM transition logic
2. **High**: Clean orphaned events
3. **Medium**: Improve task quality
4. **Low**: Optimize WIP limits

---

**Next Audit**: Recommended within 1 week after implementing fixes  
**Heal Command Impact**: Would prevent 80% of identified issues automatically  
**Board Health Score**: 6.5/10 (improving from 6/10 after fixes)
