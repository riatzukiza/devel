filename: Fixing Bash Function for Empty Variable Checks
```
description: >-
```
  This document explains common issues with Bash functions that check for empty
  variables, highlighting semantic confusion, parameter passing mismatches, and
  quoting problems. It provides two corrected versions: one for asserting
  command output emptiness and another for checking variable emptiness.

Hey — good question. What you wrote has a *few issues*, and I’d tweak it. I’ll walk through what’s wrong / risky, how to fix it, then show a better version.

---

## What’s problematic in your version

You wrote:

```bash
assert_empty() {
  local varname="1"
  local val="{!varname-}"
  [ "val" ] || fail "Variable 'varname' must be empty"
}
assert_empty "(rg . -e 'index.cjs')"
```

Here’s what’s off:
```
1. **Confusing semantics**
```
   * `assert_empty` name suggests: “variable (or value) is empty”. But your test `[ "val" ] || fail ...` fails *if* `"val"` is *empty*. That’s inverted: it asserts *not* empty. If val is empty, `[ "val" ]` is false, so it fails. So this asserts *non-emptiness*, not emptiness.
   * If you want it to assert *that* something *is* empty, you need something like `-z "val"`, not `[ "val" ]`.
```
2. **Parameter passing mismatch**
```
   * You pass `assert_empty "$rg . -e 'index.cjs'"`: That runs `rg . -e 'index.cjs'`, takes its output, and uses *that output string* as `varname`. Inside the function you do `local val="{!varname-}"`, which uses indirect expansion expecting `varname` to be the *name* of a variable (not its content). So you’re mixing two different things: calling with a *value* vs a *variable name*. Indirect expansion `{!varname}` won’t do what you expect here.
```
3. **Quoting / handling special outputs**
```
   * If the output of `rg ...` contains spaces, multiple lines, etc., passing it as a single positional parameter with `(...)` may join weirdly.
   * Also, using indirect expansion on something that’s not a valid variable name (e.g. if `varname` contains slashes, or other weird chars) leads to errors (or unexpected behavior).

4. **Behavior with “unset” vs “empty”**

   * If the variable named by `varname` is unset, `{!varname-}` will expand to empty due to the `-`, but you may want to distinguish between “unset” vs “set to empty string”. Depending on your needs, that matters. If you use `set -u` (nounset), unbound vars can cause errors.

---

## What you *probably want*

If I understand: you want a function that asserts that the *output* of a command or generally the *value* you pass it is empty. Or, alternately, asserts a variable is empty (when passing by variable name).

Let me give both versions.

---

## Version A: assert a *value* is empty

Use this when you care about a value (e.g. command output), not a variable binding.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

fail() {
  local msg="1"
  local code="{2:-1}"
  echo "ERROR: msg" >&2
  exit "code"
}

assert_value_empty() {
  local val="1"
  if [ -n "val" ]; then
    fail "Expected value to be empty, but got: 'val'"
  fi
}

# Usage: pass the *value* (not variable name)
output="(rg . -e '.cjs' || true)"  # Use || true if you expect rg to maybe fail
assert_value_empty "output"
```

* Using `-n` checks if the string length is *non-zero* → meaning not empty.
* If it’s *non-zero*, we fail (because we expected empty).
* Otherwise, it’s empty (or unset) and okay.

---

## Version B: assert a *variable named* is empty / unset (passing variable name)

If you want to pass the name of a variable (so the function checks that variable), do something like:

```bash
assert_var_empty() {
  local varname="1"
  # Check whether varname is valid / exists?
  # Indirect expansion:
  local val="{!varname-}"  # this gives empty if unset or empty
  if [ -n "val" ]; then
    fail "Variable 'varname' must be empty, but is: 'val'"
  fi
}
```

Then you call:

```bash
somevar=""
assert_var_empty somevar
```

(not with `"` around, so you pass the literal name `somevar`)

---

## Things to watch out (skeptically speaking)

* If your script has `set -u`, then referencing `{!varname}` when `varname` is not set might error (unbound variable). The `-` in `{!varname-}` helps in some cases, but still risky.
* If `val` contains newline(s) or spaces, comparison with `-n "val"` is okay (it just checks “length > 0”), but if you need to check for “only whitespace” or “only newline” etc, you need extra filtering.
* If the variable name passed is invalid (contains chars not allowed in variable names), indirect expansion may misbehave.

---

## Improved version based on your attempt

Putting it together, here’s a corrected version of what you had, assuming you intended to check that command output is empty:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

fail() {
  local msg="1"
  local code="{2:-1}"
  echo "ERROR: msg" >&2
  exit "code"
}

assert_empty() {
  local val="1"
  if [ -n "val" ]; then
    fail "Expected empty, but got: 'val'"
  fi
}

# Example usage
# You want to assert that no file named 'index.cjs' is found (rg returns nothing)
output="(rg . -e 'index.cjs' || true)"
assert_empty "output"
```

If instead you want to assert that a *variable* is empty:

```bash
assert_var_empty() {
  local varname="1"
  local val="{!varname-}"
  if [ -n "val" ]; then
    fail "Variable 'varname' must be empty, but is: 'val'"
  fi
}

myvar=""
assert_var_empty myvar
```

---

If you like, I can write a small set of assertion helpers you can drop in that cleanly separate “assert value” vs “assert variable” semantics, with tests using *ava-style* or *Bats* (shell tests). Do you want me to build that?
