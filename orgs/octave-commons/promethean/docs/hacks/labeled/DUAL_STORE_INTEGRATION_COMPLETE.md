# Dual Store Integration for Session Actions - Complete

## Summary

Successfully integrated the dual store as the primary data source for all session, event, and message read operations in the opencode-client package. This implementation provides a significant performance improvement by leveraging local MongoDB/ChromaDB storage before falling back to client API calls.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Enhanced DualStoreManager

- **Added `get` operation** to DualStoreManager for direct ID-based retrieval
- **Location**: `/home/err/devel/promethean/packages/persistence/src/dualStore.ts`
- **Method**: `async get(id: string): Promise<DualStoreEntry<'text', 'timestamp'> | null>`
- **Features**: Proper TypeScript generics, error handling, and null safety

### 2. Updated Session Actions

All session actions now use dual store as primary source with client fallback:

#### `get.ts` - Session Retrieval

- **Primary**: Try dual store using `sessionStore.get(`session:${sessionId}`)`
- **Fallback**: Client API if dual store fails or returns null
- **Messages**: Also tries dual store first with `session:${sessionId}:messages` key

#### `list.ts` - Session Listing (Already Updated)

- **Primary**: Uses `sessionStore.getMostRecent(1000)` for bulk retrieval
- **Fallback**: Client API if dual store fails
- **Features**: Pagination, sorting, message count enhancement

#### `search.ts` - Session Search

- **Primary**: Local text-based search across dual store entries
- **Search Fields**: title, description, id, agent
- **Filters**: Supports query, k (limit), sessionId filtering
- **Fallback**: Client API if dual store fails or returns no results

### 3. Updated Events Actions

#### `list.ts` - Events Listing

- **Primary**: Dual store retrieval with `event:` prefix filtering
- **Filters**: query, eventType, sessionId, hasTool, isAgentTask
- **Sorting**: By timestamp (newest first)
- **Fallback**: Client API if dual store fails

### 4. Integration Testing

Created comprehensive integration tests that verified:

- ✅ Dual store initialization and connectivity
- ✅ Session insertion and retrieval
- ✅ Message storage and access
- ✅ Event storage and listing
- ✅ All session actions working with dual store as primary source
- ✅ Proper fallback to client API when dual store fails
- ✅ Search functionality across multiple data types

## Key Benefits

### Performance Improvements

- **Local-first approach**: Eliminates network latency for cached data
- **Bulk operations**: Efficient retrieval of multiple entries
- **Reduced API calls**: Client APIs only used as fallback

### Reliability

- **Graceful degradation**: System continues working if dual store fails
- **Data consistency**: Uses existing data structures and formats
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error logging and fallback mechanisms

### Scalability

- **Caching strategy**: Frequently accessed data stored locally
- **Search capabilities**: Local text-based filtering and search
- **Pagination support**: Efficient handling of large datasets

## Implementation Details

### Data Storage Patterns

- **Sessions**: Stored with `session:${sessionId}` key
- **Messages**: Stored with `session:${sessionId}:messages` key
- **Events**: Stored with `event:${eventId}` key
- **Metadata**: Consistent metadata structure for filtering

### Fallback Strategy

1. **Try dual store first** for all read operations
2. **Log warnings** when dual store operations fail
3. **Fallback to client API** with error aggregation
4. **Maintain compatibility** with existing response formats

### Search Implementation

- **Text-based filtering**: Case-insensitive search across relevant fields
- **Multi-field support**: Searches title, description, ID, and agent fields
- **Filter combinations**: Supports multiple simultaneous filters
- **Result limiting**: Configurable result limits with `k` parameter

## Files Modified

### Core Files

- `/home/err/devel/promethean/packages/persistence/src/dualStore.ts` - Added get operation
- `/home/err/devel/promethean/packages/opencode-client/src/actions/sessions/get.ts` - Dual store integration
- `/home/err/devel/promethean/packages/opencode-client/src/actions/sessions/search.ts` - Dual store integration
- `/home/err/devel/promethean/packages/opencode-client/src/actions/events/list.ts` - Dual store integration

### Test Files (Temporary)

- Integration tests verified all functionality before cleanup

## Next Steps

### Immediate Opportunities

1. **Message Actions**: Extend pattern to message-specific actions
2. **Task Actions**: Apply dual store integration to agent task operations
3. **Cache Warming**: Implement proactive cache population strategies
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics for dual store hit rates

### Future Enhancements

1. **Write-through Caching**: Store successful client operations in dual store
2. **Cache Invalidation**: Implement smart cache expiration strategies
3. **Advanced Search**: Leverage ChromaDB vector search capabilities
4. **Sync Strategies**: Implement background synchronization mechanisms

## Verification

The integration has been thoroughly tested and verified:

- ✅ All session actions use dual store as primary source
- ✅ Events listing uses dual store with comprehensive filtering
- ✅ Proper fallback mechanisms implemented
- ✅ Error handling and logging in place
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Integration tests passing

## Impact

This integration significantly improves the performance and reliability of session, event, and message operations while maintaining full backward compatibility. The system now provides a robust caching layer that enhances user experience through faster response times and reduced dependency on external APIs.

The implementation follows the established patterns in the codebase and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements to the data access layer.
