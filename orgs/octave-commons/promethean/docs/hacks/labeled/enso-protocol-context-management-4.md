filename: Enso Protocol Context Management
description: >-
  The Enso protocol defines how users manage data sources within contexts,
  including metadata, discoverability, state transitions, and content
  permissions. It ensures data visibility, control, and availability through
  explicit and implicit rules. This system allows users to curate and share data
  securely across contexts.

Context management is also an important feature of the enso protocol.
A users own contributions of a given conversation must be both visible, and controllable.
Users should be able to curate files/data sources for LLM usage, a data source can have several properties.
The specifics as to how the following are implemented can vary by implementation, but all must be present:

## Metadata

- owner(s): the user(s) or group(s) who owns a piece of data, and is allowed to decide it's availability to contexts
- source: Where is this data from? (fs, api, database, etc)
- location: How the data source is uniquely identified by a source.

## Discoverability

To a given context instance, a data source may be explicitly, or implicitly:

- invisible: The protocol is unaware of its existance
- discoverable: The protocol is able to discover this assets existance if there are links to it from a context session
- visible: The protocol is aware of it's existance
- hidden: Distinct from invisible, can only be found with a direct reference.

Explicitly a user can set these states ephemerally to a specific context for a data source. This is forgotten at the end of the context
Implicitly, a user can control discoverability by setting other properties or rules

## Context State

For a given context, a data source may be in one of the following states:
- active: Is currently a part of the context
- inactive: Is currently not a part of the context
- standby: Is discoverable from currently active context
- pinned: Explicitly added to the current context.
- ignored: Explicitly excluded from the current context

## Content management

From a given context, data source can be managed in some or all of the following ways:
- Readable: it's content can be a part of context
- Changable: It's content can be modified, but a record of all states is kept by the owner for a time, configurable by the user
- Movable: It can be renamed/moved
- Exchanged: Ownership transfered to another user (the original owner does not retain a copy)
- Sendable: A copy is given to another user (the original owner retains a copy)
- Addable: Added to the protocol for context management
- Removable: Removed from the protocol, no longer available to any context unless added
- deletable: Rarely, the protocol can delete a piece of date entirely, leaving no record of it's existance
- saveable: The current content saved to a file on the client's drive
- viewable: It's content made visible to users of the context other than the owner

## Availability
- private: Is only available in contexts exclusive to the owner (1 agent 1 user, many agents, 1 user)
- public: Is available in all contexts regardless of participants
- shared: Is available in contexts with explicitly set members
- conditional: Is available in contexts that match a sets of conditions.
  - Conditions may be "hard" (rules based) or "soft" (An LLM evaluates your condition).
  - Soft conditions always ask for approval,
  - hard conditions are met automatically
  - the requirement of approval is a possible condition
