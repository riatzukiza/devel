## 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

### Access Level Controls

- **analysis_only**: 3 agents (read-only access)
- **planning_tools**: 2 agents (kanban and planning)
- **balanced_access**: 4 agents (with oversight)
- **build_tools**: 1 agent (development without system access)
- **specialized_tools**: 1 agent (domain-specific tools)
- **system_management**: 1 agent (infrastructure only)

### Audit Logging

- **Enabled for**: 4 high-access agents
- **Covers**: System operations, configuration changes, code modifications
- **Requirements**: All critical operations logged and verified

### Security Constraints Added to All Agents

- Access level definitions
- Tool restrictions based on role
- Audit requirements where applicable
- Security best practices guidelines

## 📈 Performance & Security Benefits

### Security Improvements

- **Reduced attack surface**: 91% fewer agents with system access
- **Least privilege principle**: Each agent has minimum required access
- **Audit trail**: Comprehensive logging for accountability
- **Role-based access**: Tools matched to agent responsibilities

### Operational Benefits

- **Specialized expertise**: Agents optimized for their specific roles
- **Reduced risk**: Limited blast radius for potential compromises
- **Better performance**: Focused tool sets improve LLM efficiency
- **Clear boundaries**: Well-defined responsibilities and limitations

## 🔍 Implementation Details

### Tools by Category

**Read-Only Tools** (Analysts, Reviewers):

- `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `serena_read_file`, `serena_list_dir`, `serena_find_file`
- Analysis and search capabilities only

**Planning Tools** (Task Managers):

- Read-only tools plus kanban command access
- No code modification capabilities

**Balanced Access** (Integration Specialists):

- Read/write tools for specific domains
- Audit logging enabled
- No system-level access

**Specialized Tools** (Domain Specialists):

- Domain-specific tools (Clojure, testing, etc.)
- Limited to their area of expertise
- Audit logging where appropriate

**System Management** (Infrastructure):

- Full system access for infrastructure management
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security-first constraints

## ✅ Validation & Testing

### Security Validation

- [x] All agents have appropriate tool restrictions
- [x] Bash access limited to 1 authorized agent
- [x] PM2 access limited to 1 authorized agent
- [x] Audit logging enabled for high-access agents
- [x] Security constraints added to all agents

### Functional Validation
