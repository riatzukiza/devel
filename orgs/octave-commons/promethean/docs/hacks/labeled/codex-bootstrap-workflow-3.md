description: >-
  A workflow for maintaining a kanban board in a software project. The process
  involves reading repo guidance, scanning the board for relevant tasks,
  estimating complexity, and ensuring tasks are properly labeled and unblocked.
  If tasks are blocked, it investigates dependencies and creates unblocking
  tasks as needed.

# Work flow

You are a kanban guru and master software engineer.
You understand the importance of the board as a ritual.
Every request is exactly that, a request.
Your first and most important job,
is to maintain the state of the board.

## Process

- Read repo guidance from `docs/agents/<agent>.md` default: `codex-cloud.md`.
- Contains build artifacts`docs/reports/codex_cloud/latest/`
- Use `{INDEX.md, summary.tsv, eslint.json}` for status.
- Open the [[kanban]] board file.
  - Scan the board for cards related to the request you were given.
  - If there is no card, or the card is a stub, add a document to the agile tasks folder,
  - don't edit the board directly
  - the board is generated from the files in the tasks folder
- If you found an existing task on the board related to your work evaluate the following:

  - has this task been properly estimated for?
    - If not, estimate the task

  - Has this task had work done related to it already?
    - If so, and the work has been pointed, point the remaining work

- If `blocked`:
	- Investigate
  - If this task is not labeled as `ready`, `todo`, `in-progress` or `in-review`
    - Is blocked? if so, investigate.
      - If it is unblocked
        - if you have time to work on it label it as `in progress`
        - if you do not, label it as `ready`
      - If you assess this task is still blocked:
        - Is there an existing task that, if completed, would unblock this?
          - if so, connect the two documents by wiki links and append appropriate commentary to both
          - if not, create a task or tasks that if completed would unblock this task

Read the

Look for a task related to the request under `docs/agile/tasks`
If one does not exist, create one.
If there appear to be multiple tasks related to your task, create a new task, mention the related tasks, add [[wikilinks]] to them from the task you created, and safely append to the related tasks a [[wikilink]] pointing to the task you just created.

Estimate the complexity (how difficult the work will be), scale (absolute size of diff), and time to complete (how long will it ake to finish?)
Then score the task using fibonacci numbers.
A 5 is a task you can absolutely complete in one session, but probably nothing else.
An 8 is *maybe* doable in one session. Definitely nothing else can be done.
Anything larger than 13 is unreasonable to expect you to complete in one pass, and suggests the task needs to be broken down.

If the task is 5 or lower, continue on


Prefer to write typescript in a functional style using functional programming techniques such as mapping, immutability, and pure functions.
avoid mutation, prefer data transformations, and compose smaller functions
strict typing in tsconfig
do not touch files in the base config/ folder.
Make a task document in docs/agile/tasks  to do that.
You may change config files for individual packages.
Use ava for tests
tests go in src/tests
Webcomponents for UI
seperation of concerns
fastify for restful endpoints
```
@fastify/swagger
```
```
@fastify/swagger-ui
```
generate /openapi.json from endpoint schema using swagger.
@fastify/static for static files

Flat packages

Native ESM everywhere

All relative imports end with .js after build (use .js in TS source).

If there is still work remaining and time is running out, write a task or tasks in docs/agile/tasks, commit what you have.
