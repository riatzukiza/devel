```
  A DoD-aligned tracker for monitoring task completion against process
  definitions, with append-only logging and strict WIP checks. Tracks
  contradictions between workflow prompts, process docs, and board states while
  ensuring process changes are evidence-based.

# Codex Cloud — Process Tracker DoD-aligned
```
*Last update: 2025-09-19 19:00 America/Chicago*
```
This single doc tracks every checkbox from your request and our Definition of Done. I’ll keep it append-only (new dated logs at the bottom) and tick items only when they’re truly achieved.

## Master Tasks

### 1) Identify contradictions between the board, the workflow prompt, the process doc, and AGENTS.md

* [ ] the board — **pending** (need current board source; see Next actions)
* [ ] workflow prompt system\_prompt.md — contradictions noted
* [ ] process document — contradictions noted
* [ ] AGENTS.md — contradictions noted
```
**Notes:**
```
* Status driver conflict (hashtags vs front‑matter), incomplete hashtag set, WIP rules missing in prompt, stage label inconsistencies, and board/edit direction mismatch captured.

### 2) Identify unclear elements

* [ ] instructions — clarified
* [ ] descriptions — clarified
* [ ] transitions — clarified added entry/exit criteria
* [ ] rules — clarified hashtags are canonical, WIP = Σ(score)

### 3) Suggest changes to the **process document** to reflect reality (and board)

* [ ] Drafted changes: canonical hashtag set; estimation schema complexity/scale/time\_hours ⇒ score; WIP by Σ(score) with defaults; PromptRefine vs AgentThinking; Definition of Ready/Done; path fixes
* [ ] Validated against current board state
* [ ] Applied edits into `process.md` (pending your approval)

### 4) Suggest changes to the **board** to better represent the process

* [ ] Drafted changes: columns mirror full hashtag set; column headers show WIP caps by Σ(score); generator reads **last** status hashtag; emits WIP CONFLICT section
* [ ] Wrote step‑by‑step implementation guidelines in repo docs
* [ ] Regenerated board and remediated conflicts (blocked until current board is loaded)

### 5) Execute the process with the **Golden task: Create a Generic Markdown Helper Module**

* [ ] Prepared append‑only update block for the task log + normalized estimates + status hashtag
* [ ] Performed WIP check against current `#InProgress` Σ(score)
* [ ] Moved task to `#InProgress` (only if WIP allows)
* [ ] Implemented package + tests + docs
* [ ] Opened PR(s) and linked to task; moved to `#InReview`
* [ ] Documented; final summary appended; moved to `#Done` (after your confirmation)

## Requirements Tracker

### Strict Kanban team no sprints/stand‑ups/retrospectives/meetings — only the board, its rules, rituals, transitions, WIP limits

* [ ] Evidence prepared: Process updates + Board WIP configuration embedded in headers

### The process is flexible; includes a process to change the process

* [ ] Evidence prepared: add a "Meta‑Process for Process Changes" section in `process.md`

### Minimal system prompt that encapsulates the process

* [x] Drafted compact system prompt (process‑first, WIP‑aware)
* [ ] Verified and accepted by you; published to `system_prompt.md`

---

## Definition of Done (per task we touch)

* [x] A log of our work is kept in the task file (append‑only snippet prepared for Golden task)
* [ ] You confirm the task is complete before marking as complete
* [ ] We mark the task as complete with a summary of actions taken

---

## Next Actions

1. **Load the current board** (source of truth). Options:

   * Provide the board markdown here, or
   * Confirm the canonical URL so I can load it, or
   * Attach the generated board file you want me to use.
2. Run WIP check for `#InProgress` Σ(score) ≤ 13. If it passes, flip Golden task to `#InProgress` and begin implementation; if not, record a WIP CONFLICT and queue the task in `#Todo`.
3. On approval, apply concrete edits to `process.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `system_prompt.md` and regenerate the board.

## Audit Log

* **2025-09-19 19:00** — Initialized tracker; ticked completed items; awaiting current board to continue WIP checks and task movement.
