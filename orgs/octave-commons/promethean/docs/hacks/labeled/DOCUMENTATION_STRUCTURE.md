# Documentation Structure Guide

## 📁 Directory Organization

### Root Level Documentation

- `agile/` - Kanban board, tasks, epics, and agile process documentation
- `adr/` - Architecture Decision Records
- `inbox/` - Temporary holding area for new documents (agents should move files from here)
- `reference/` - Technical reference materials and guides
- `external/` - External documentation and references
- `prompts/` - Prompt templates and optimization guides
  - `optimized/` - Optimized prompt templates

### Reports Structure

- `reports/` - All project reports organized by category
  - `agile/` - Kanban board reports, workflow analysis, process metrics
  - `benchmark/` - Performance benchmarks, BuildFix reports, optimization results
  - `security/` - Security analyses, threat models, vulnerability reports
  - `general/` - General project reports, summaries, analyses

## 🤖 Agent Guidelines

### File Placement Rules

1. **Reports**: Always place in appropriate `reports/` subdirectory
2. **External References**: Use `external/` for third-party documentation
3. **Reference Materials**: Use `reference/` for internal technical guides
4. **New Documents**: Start in `inbox/`, then move to proper location
5. **Prompts**: Use `prompts/optimized/` for optimized prompt templates

### Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Include date prefixes for time-sensitive reports: `YYYY-MM-DD-report-name.md`
- Use descriptive names that indicate content type and purpose

### Cleanup Responsibilities

- Remove backup files (`.bak`, `.backup`, `*~`)
- Consolidate duplicate content
- Move temporary files to proper locations
- Update indexes when adding new documentation

## 🔄 Migration Status

### Completed ✅

- Root directory scripts moved to categorized `scripts/` directories
- Security reports moved to `reports/security/`
- Benchmark reports moved to `reports/benchmark/`
- Agile reports moved to `reports/agile/`
- External references moved to `external/`
- Backup files removed from `agile/`

### In Progress 🔄

- Consolidating remaining duplicate files
- Creating automated cleanup processes
- Establishing agent behavior guidelines

## 📋 Quick Reference

| File Type         | Location             | Example                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Kanban Report     | `reports/agile/`     | `kanban-audit-report.md`          |
| Benchmark         | `reports/benchmark/` | `buildfix-performance.md`         |
| Security Analysis | `reports/security/`  | `threat-modeling-analysis.md`     |
| External Doc      | `external/`          | `obsidian-tracker-guide.md`       |
| Technical Guide   | `reference/`         | `workspace-organization-guide.md` |
| Prompt Template   | `prompts/optimized/` | `code-review-prompt.md`           |

## 🚫 What to Avoid

- **DO NOT** dump files in `docs/` root
- **DO NOT** create backup files in version control
- **DO NOT** use generic names like `untitled-1.md`
- **DO NOT** duplicate existing documentation
- **DO NOT** mix reports with reference documentation

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. Check `inbox/` for misplaced files
2. Remove temporary and backup files
3. Consolidate duplicate content
4. Update this structure guide as needed

### Automated Processes

- Scripts should check file location before creation
- Use semantic search to find existing content before creating new files
- Follow established naming conventions
- Move files from `inbox/` to proper locations within 24 hours
