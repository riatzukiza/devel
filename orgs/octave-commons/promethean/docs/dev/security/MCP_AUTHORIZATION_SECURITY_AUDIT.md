# MCP Authorization Security Audit Report

## Security Vulnerability Identified

**Task ID**: a394e11e-a8ca-407c-bb9f-56958c789f67  
**Title**: Add Missing Authorization/Access Control for Destructive Operations in MCP Tools  
**Priority**: P0  
**Risk Level**: High

### Executive Summary

A security vulnerability has been identified in the MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools where destructive operations lack proper authorization and access control mechanisms. This allows unauthorized users to perform actions that could affect system integrity, data security, and operational stability.

### Current Security Posture

#### ✅ Existing Security Measures

- Path validation and traversal protection
- Rate limiting (100 requests/minute)
- Basic audit logging
- File size restrictions (1MB default)
- Input sanitization

#### ❌ Critical Security Gaps

1. **Incomplete Role Coverage**: Only covers demo tools, not actual MCP tools
2. **Missing Authorization**: Real destructive tools have no access controls
3. **No Granular Permissions**: All-or-nothing access per role
4. **Insufficient Audit Trail**: Limited security event logging
5. **No Security Context**: Missing security validation for destructive operations
