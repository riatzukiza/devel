# Epic: Pantheon Core Framework Implementation

## Overview

This epic covers the implementation of the foundational core framework for the Pantheon Agent Management System. The core framework provides the essential building blocks including type definitions, port interfaces, actor model, and orchestration engine following a hexagonal architecture pattern.

## Business Value

- Establishes the architectural foundation for the entire Pantheon system
- Enables clean separation of concerns through ports/adapters pattern
- Provides unified type system across all agent-related functionality
- Creates extensible actor model with behaviors and talents
- Implements core orchestration engine for agent coordination

## Success Metrics

- Core framework passes all unit and integration tests
- Type system covers all required agent concepts (actors, behaviors, talents, actions)
- Port interfaces enable clean dependency injection
- Actor model supports dynamic behavior selection and talent composition
- Orchestrator can coordinate multiple actors with different goals

**Dependencies:** pantheon-core-001, pantheon-core-002, pantheon-core-003

**Description:**  
Enhance the orchestrator engine in `packages/pantheon-core/src/core/orchestrator.ts` with advanced action execution, behavior selection logic, actor lifecycle management, and comprehensive error handling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Action execution handles all action types (tool, message, spawn)
- [ ] Behavior selection logic considers user input and behavior modes
- [ ] Actor ticking supports both manual and scheduled execution
- [ ] Actor loop management with proper cleanup and error recovery
- [ ] Context compilation integration with behavior planning

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risks

1. **Complexity of actor model** - May be difficult to implement and debug
2. **Port interface design** - May not cover all use cases
3. **Performance with multiple actors** - May have scalability issues
4. **Type system completeness** - May miss edge cases

### Mitigations

1. **Incremental implementation** - Start with basic actor model, enhance gradually
2. **Iterative port design** - Implement basic ports first, extend based on usage
3. **Performance testing** - Include performance tests from the beginning
4. **Type system validation** - Use real-world scenarios to validate type coverage
