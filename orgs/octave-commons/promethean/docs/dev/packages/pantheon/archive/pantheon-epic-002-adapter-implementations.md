# Epic: Pantheon Adapter Implementations

## Overview

This epic covers the implementation of adapter implementations for the Pantheon framework. Adapters provide concrete implementations of the port interfaces defined in the core framework, enabling integration with external systems like LLM providers, context stores, tool systems, and transport protocols.

## Business Value

- Enables integration with major LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, OpenCode)
- Provides robust context management with event sourcing and persistence
- Supports tool integration across multiple runtime environments (MCP, local, HTTP)
- Implements reliable transport protocols for agent communication
- Creates pluggable architecture for future adapter additions

## Success Metrics

- All major LLM providers are integrated and tested
- Context management supports event sourcing and snapshots
- Tool adapters work across different runtime environments
- Transport protocols are reliable and performant
- All adapters follow consistent patterns and interfaces
- Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
