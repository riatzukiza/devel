## 🎯 Task Overview\n\nRefactor complex functions (visit, plan, writeTasks) that exceed complexity thresholds in the @promethean-os/simtasks package.\n\n## 📋 Description\n\nThis task addresses the function complexity issues identified in the code review. Several functions exceed acceptable complexity thresholds and need to be refactored into smaller, more focused functions.\n\n## 🚨 Current Complexity Issues\n\n**Functions exceeding thresholds:**\n-  function: 60 lines, complexity 18, cognitive complexity 34\n-  function: 96 lines  \n-  function: 133 lines, complexity 32, cognitive complexity 25\n\n## 🔍 Scope\n\n**Files to be refactored:**\n- 04-plan.ts (visit and plan functions)\n- 05-write.ts (writeTasks function)\n\n## 📝 Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] visit() function complexity reduced from 18 to <10\n- [ ] plan() function (96 lines) broken into smaller functions\n- [ ] writeTasks() function complexity reduced from 32 to <10\n- [ ] Cognitive complexity of all functions <15\n- [ ] Functions maintain single responsibility principle\n- [ ] All extracted functions are properly tested\n- [ ] Existing functionality preserved\n\n## 🎯 Story Points: 8\n\n**Breakdown:**\n- Refactor visit() function (60 lines, complexity 18): 3 points\n- Refactor plan() function (96 lines): 3 points\n- Refactor writeTasks() function (133 lines, complexity 32): 2 points\n\n## 🚧 Implementation Strategy\n\n### visit() Function Refactoring\n- Break down into smaller, focused functions\n- Extract validation logic\n- Separate processing steps\n- Improve readability and testability\n\n### plan() Function Refactoring  \n- Extract logical sections into separate, testable functions\n- Separate data preparation from processing\n- Create helper functions for complex calculations\n- Simplify main control flow\n\n### writeTasks() Function Refactoring\n- Simplify by extracting validation and processing logic\n- Separate file operations from data transformation\n- Create focused helper functions\n- Reduce nesting and complexity\n\n## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations\n\n- **Risk:** Breaking existing functionality\n- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing and gradual refactoring\n- **Risk:** Performance impact\n- **Mitigation:** Benchmark before and after refactoring\n- **Risk:** Increased code complexity\n- **Mitigation:** Focus on single responsibility and clear naming\n\n## 📚 Dependencies\n\n- Should be completed after type safety improvements\n- Prerequisite for comprehensive testing\n- Enables better error handling implementation\n\n## 🧪 Testing Requirements\n\n- All existing tests must continue to pass\n- Add unit tests for extracted functions\n- Integration tests to verify refactored workflows\n- Performance benchmarks to ensure no regression
