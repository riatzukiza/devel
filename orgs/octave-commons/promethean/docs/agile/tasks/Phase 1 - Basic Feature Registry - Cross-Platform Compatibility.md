# Phase 1: Basic Feature Registry - Cross-Platform Compatibility

## 🎯 Objective

Implement a basic feature registry system that can register, manage, and query platform features. This registry will serve as the central hub for feature availability checking and will be used by all platform adapters to declare their capabilities.

## 📋 Scope

### Core Registry Functionality

1. **Feature Registration**

   - Register new features with metadata
   - Support feature updates and modifications
   - Handle feature unregistration

2. **Feature Querying**

   - Check feature availability by ID
   - List all registered features
   - Filter features by criteria

3. **Feature Management**

   - Enable/disable features
   - Get feature information and metadata
   - Manage feature dependencies

4. **Registry State Management**
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Persistent registry state
   - Registry initialization and cleanup

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Feature Registry Implementation

```clojure
(ns promethean.compatibility.feature-registry
  (:require [promethean.compatibility.protocols :as protocols]
            [clojure.core.async :as async]))

(defrecord BasicFeatureRegistry [features-atom features-by-capability-atom])

(defn create-feature-registry []
  "Create a new feature registry instance"
  (let [features-atom (atom {})
        features-by-capability-atom (atom {})]
    (->BasicFeatureRegistry features-atom features-by-capability-atom)))

;; Feature registration
(defn register-feature!
  [registry feature-info]
  "Register a new feature in the registry"
  (let [feature-id (:id feature-info)]
    (swap! (:features-atom registry) assoc feature-id feature-info)
    ;; Update capability index
    (doseq [capability (:capabilities feature-info)]
      (swap! (:features-by-capability-atom registry)
             update capability
             conj feature-id))
    feature-id))

(defn unregister-feature!
  [registry feature-id]
  "Unregister a feature from the registry"
  (when-let [feature-info (get @(:features-atom registry) feature-id)]
    (swap! (:features-atom registry) dissoc feature-id)
    ;; Update capability index
    (doseq [capability (:capabilities feature-info)]
      (swap! (:features-by-capability-atom registry)
             update capability
             (fn [features] (remove #(= % feature-id) features))))
    feature-id))

;; Feature querying
(defn get-feature
  [registry feature-id]
  "Get feature information by ID"
  (get @(:features-atom registry) feature-id))

(defn feature-available?
  [registry feature-id]
  "Check if a feature is available and enabled"
  (when-let [feature-info (get @(:features-atom registry) feature-id)]
    (:enabled? feature-info)))

(defn list-features
  [registry]
  "List all registered features"
  (vals @(:features-atom registry)))

(defn find-features-by-capability
  [registry capability]
  "Find features that provide a specific capability"
  (let [feature-ids (get @(:features-by-capability-atom registry) capability [])]
    (map #(get @(:features-atom registry) %) feature-ids)))

;; Feature management
(defn enable-feature!
  [registry feature-id]
  "Enable a feature"
  (swap! (:features-atom registry)
         update-in [feature-id :enabled?]
         (constantly true)))

(defn disable-feature!
  [registry feature-id]
  "Disable a feature"
  (swap! (:features-atom registry)
         update-in [feature-id :enabled?]
         (constantly false)))

(defn update-feature!
  [registry feature-id updates]
  "Update feature information"
  (swap! (:features-atom registry)
         update feature-id
         merge updates)
  ;; Rebuild capability index if capabilities changed
  (when (contains? updates :capabilities)
    (rebuild-capability-index! registry)))

### Registry Initialization

```clojure
(ns promethean.compatibility.registry-init)

(def ^:dynamic *global-registry* nil)

(defn initialize-registry!
  "Initialize the global feature registry"
  []
  (let [registry (create-feature-registry)]
    (register-core-features! registry)
    (alter-var-root #'*global-registry* (constantly registry))
    registry))

(defn get-global-registry
  "Get the global feature registry"
  (or *global-registry*
      (initialize-registry!)))

(defn with-registry
  [registry f]
  "Execute function with specific registry"
  (binding [*global-registry* registry]
    (f)))
