# Integrate boardrev with piper pipeline system

## Description
Current manual sequential script execution should be replaced with proper pipeline orchestration using @promethean-os/piper.

## Proposed Solution
- Create piper pipeline definition for boardrev workflow
- Enable parallel execution where possible
- Add caching between pipeline steps
- Implement retry logic and error handling
- Add pipeline monitoring and logging

## Benefits
- Parallel execution for better performance
- Better error handling and recovery
- Pipeline caching reduces redundant work
- Standardized execution model
- Integration with existing pipeline infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Piper pipeline definition created
- [ ] Parallel execution for independent steps
- [ ] Caching between pipeline steps
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Pipeline monitoring integration
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing CLI scripts

## Technical Details
- **Pipeline steps**: index → match → evaluate → report
- **Parallel opportunities**: File indexing can be parallelized
- **Cache keys**: Based on file hashes and model versions
- **Pipeline file**: `pipelines/boardrev.json`
- **CLI integration**: `pnpm piper run boardrev`

## Notes
Should maintain existing CLI interfaces for backward compatibility while adding pipeline capabilities.
