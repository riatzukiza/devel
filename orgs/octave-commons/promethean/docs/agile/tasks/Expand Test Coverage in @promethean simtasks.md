## 🎯 Task Overview\n\nImplement comprehensive test suite covering integration, error scenarios, and performance for the @promethean-os/simtasks package.\n\n## 📋 Description\n\nThis task addresses the testing gaps identified in the code review. Currently the package has minimal test coverage and is missing integration tests, error scenario tests, and performance tests.\n\n## 🔍 Scope\n\n**Files to be created/updated:**\n- New test files for comprehensive coverage\n- Update existing test files\n- Test fixtures and data sets\n- Performance benchmark tests\n\n## 📝 Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 80% of codebase\n- [ ] Integration tests cover end-to-end workflows\n- [ ] Error scenario tests cover all failure modes\n- [ ] Performance tests validate memory usage and processing speed\n- [ ] Tests are fast, reliable, and maintainable\n- [ ] Mock implementations for external dependencies\n- [ ] All tests pass consistently\n\n## 🎯 Story Points: 10\n\n**Breakdown:**\n- Add unit tests for core processing functions: 3 points\n- Add integration tests for pipeline workflows: 3 points\n- Add error scenario tests: 2 points\n- Add performance and memory tests: 2 points\n\n## 🚧 Implementation Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Test individual functions in all processing modules\n- Focus on business logic and data transformation\n- Mock external dependencies (file system, APIs)\n- Cover edge cases and boundary conditions\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Test complete processing pipelines with real data\n- Verify data flow between processing stages\n- Test configuration and setup scenarios\n- Validate end-to-end functionality\n\n### Error Scenario Tests\n- Test all error conditions and recovery mechanisms\n- Simulate failures in external dependencies\n- Validate error handling and logging\n- Test graceful degradation scenarios\n\n### Performance Tests\n- Validate memory usage under load\n- Test processing speed with large datasets\n- Benchmark individual processing stages\n- Monitor resource utilization\n\n### Test Infrastructure\n- Create reusable test fixtures and data sets\n- Implement test utilities and helpers\n- Set up continuous integration testing\n- Configure test reporting and coverage\n\n## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations\n\n- **Risk:** Complex test setup requirements\n- **Mitigation:** Create comprehensive test fixtures and utilities\n- **Risk:** Slow test execution\n- **Mitigation:** Focus on unit tests and selective integration tests\n- **Risk:** External dependency testing\n- **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive mocking strategies\n\n## 📚 Dependencies\n\n- Should be completed after error handling implementation\n- Requires type safety improvements for reliable testing\n- Benefits from function complexity reduction\n\n## 🧪 Testing Requirements\n\n### Test Categories\n1. **Unit Tests:** Individual function testing\n2. **Integration Tests:** End-to-end workflow testing\n3. **Error Tests:** Failure scenario testing\n4. **Performance Tests:** Resource usage and speed testing\n\n### Test Coverage Goals\n- >80% line coverage\n- >90% branch coverage for critical paths\n- 100% coverage for public APIs\n- Comprehensive edge case coverage\n\n### Test Quality Standards\n- Fast execution (<5 seconds for unit tests)\n- Reliable and deterministic results\n- Clear test documentation and examples\n- Proper test isolation and cleanup
