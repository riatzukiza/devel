## Problem\n\nCode duplication analysis revealed inconsistent testing patterns and utilities across packages:\n- Each package implements its own test helpers and fixtures\n- Duplicate test setup code in multiple packages\n- Inconsistent testing patterns and approaches\n- Missing shared testing utilities for common scenarios\n\n## Current State\n\n- No centralized testing utilities library\n- Duplicate test helper functions across packages\n- Inconsistent mock implementations\n- Repeated test setup and teardown patterns\n- Missing common test fixtures and data\n\n## Solution\n\nCreate an enhanced  package that provides comprehensive testing utilities, fixtures, and helpers to eliminate duplication and standardize testing across the Promethean Framework.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Phase 1: Testing Pattern Analysis\n- [ ] Audit existing test files for common patterns\n- [ ] Identify duplicate test utilities and helpers\n- [ ] Map common testing scenarios (API, database, services, etc.)\n- [ ] Analyze current testing frameworks and tools in use\n\n### Phase 2: Core Test Utilities Package\nCreate  with comprehensive testing utilities:\n\n#### Test Setup & Teardown\n\n\n#### HTTP Testing Utilities\n\n\n#### Database Testing Utilities\n\n\n#### Mock Utilities\n\n\n### Phase 3: Specialized Testing Utilities\n\n#### Service Testing\n\n\n#### MCP Testing\n\n\n#### Integration Testing\n\n\n### Phase 4: Test Data Management\n\n#### Test Factories\n\n\n#### Test Scenarios\n\n\n### Phase 5: Performance & Load Testing\n\n#### Performance Testing Utilities\n\n\n## Files to Create\n\n\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Basic Service Testing\n\n\n### MCP Tool Testing\n\n\n## Migration Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Add Package\n- [ ] Create  package\n- [ ] Implement core utilities\n- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation\n\n### Phase 2: Gradual Adoption\n- [ ] Update one package at a time to use shared test utils\n- [ ] Provide migration examples\n- [ ] Gather feedback and improve utilities\n\n### Phase 3: Cleanup\n- [ ] Remove duplicate test utilities from packages\n- [ ] Update package.json dependencies\n- [ ] Consolidate test documentation\n\n## Expected Impact\n\n- **Consistency**: Standardized testing patterns across all packages\n- **Quality**: Better test coverage and reliability\n- **Development Speed**: Reduced test setup time\n- **Maintenance**: Centralized test utilities and fixtures\n- **Developer Experience**: Simplified test creation\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- [ ] All packages use shared test utilities\n- [ ] 500+ lines of duplicate test code eliminated\n- [ ] Test setup time reduced by 60%\n- [ ] Consistent test patterns across packages\n- [ ] Improved test coverage and reliability\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Requires coordination with package maintainers\n- Need to ensure compatibility with existing test frameworks\n- Should integrate with CI/CD pipelines\n- Must maintain backward compatibility during transition
