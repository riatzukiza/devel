# Analyze Current Kanban Architecture

## 🎯 Task Overview

Conduct comprehensive analysis of the current kanban system architecture to understand all components, dependencies, and integration points before implementing the migration system.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document current FSM state machine implementation
- [ ] Identify all files that reference status values
- [ ] Map dependency relationships between kanban components
- [ ] Analyze current transition rule implementation
- [ ] Document integration points with file-indexer and agents-workflow

## 🔍 Analysis Areas

### Core Kanban Components

- `promethean.kanban.json` - Configuration and status definitions
- `docs/agile/process.md` - FSM rules and workflow documentation
- `docs/agile/rules/kanban_transitions.clj` - Transition rule DSL implementation
- `@promethean-os/kanban` package - Core kanban functionality

### Integration Points

- `packages/file-indexer/` - File scanning and context analysis
- `packages/agents-workflow/` - Agent workflow system integration
- `packages/migrations/` - Existing migration infrastructure

### Status Value References

- Task files in `docs/agile/tasks/`
- Board generation logic
- CLI commands and validation
- Agent tool integrations

## 🎯 Definition of Done

Analysis complete with comprehensive documentation covering:

1. Current architecture overview and component mapping
2. All status value references and their locations
3. Dependency relationships and integration points
4. Current transition rule implementation details
5. Identified risks and considerations for migration
