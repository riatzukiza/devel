## Task: Implement performance optimizations and caching\n\n### Description\nOptimize the adapter system for performance, particularly for remote adapters and large datasets, implementing caching strategies and performance monitoring.\n\n### Requirements\n1. Implement caching layer:\n   - Task data caching with TTL\n   - API response caching for remote adapters\n   - Incremental sync to avoid full data transfers\n   - Cache invalidation strategies\n\n2. Performance optimizations:\n   - Concurrent operations where possible\n   - Streaming for large datasets\n   - Pagination handling for remote APIs\n   - Connection pooling for HTTP requests\n\n3. Monitoring and metrics:\n   - Operation timing and performance metrics\n   - Cache hit/miss ratios\n   - API rate limit monitoring\n   - Error rate tracking\n\n4. Resource management:\n   - Memory usage optimization\n   - File handle management\n   - HTTP connection cleanup\n   - Background task processing\n\n5. Batch operations:\n   - Bulk task creation/updates\n   - Batch API requests\n   - Optimized conflict resolution\n   - Efficient change detection\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Caching system implemented with configurable TTL\n- Performance metrics collection and reporting\n- Memory usage optimized for large datasets\n- Concurrent operations implemented safely\n- Benchmark tests showing performance improvements\n- Configuration options for performance tuning\n\n### Dependencies\n- Tasks 1-9: All adapter implementations\n- Task 10: Test suite completion\n\n### Priority\nP2 - Important for production use
