## 🎯 Epic: Epic Functionality for Kanban Board

### Problem Summary

The kanban board lacks proper epic functionality to group related tasks and manage large work items that span multiple smaller tasks.

### Technical Details

- **Component**: Kanban Board System
- **Feature Type**: Core Functionality Enhancement
- **Impact**: Better project organization and tracking
- **Priority**: P0 (Critical for project management)

### Core Requirements

- Epic task type with ability to link/unlink subtasks
- Operations: add-task, remove-task to manage subtask relationships
- Transition validation: epics can only transition when all linked subtasks have passed through the same workflow steps
- Event log integration for validation of subtask transitions
- Epic status reflects aggregate status of linked subtasks

### Breakdown Tasks

#### Phase 1: Design & Architecture (3 hours)

- [ ] Design epic-subtask data model
- [ ] Plan epic transition validation logic
- [ ] Design CLI commands for epic management
- [ ] Plan UI changes for epic display
- [ ] Create technical specification

#### Phase 2: Core Implementation (8 hours)

- [ ] Extend task schema for epic relationships
- [ ] Implement epic creation and linking logic
- [ ] Add epic-specific CLI operations
- [ ] Implement transition validation for epics
- [ ] Create event log validation system
- [ ] Update board generation for epic display

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (4 hours)

- [ ] Create epic management test suite
- [ ] Test transition validation scenarios
- [ ] Verify epic status aggregation
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Performance testing with large epics

#### Phase 4: Integration & Documentation (2 hours)

- [ ] Integrate with existing FSM rules
- [ ] Update CLI documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for epic functionality
- [ ] Conduct integration testing
- [ ] Team training and rollout

### Technical Implementation

- Extend task schema to include epic/subtask relationships
- Add epic-specific operations to kanban CLI
- Implement transition validation logic that checks subtask event logs
- Update board generation to display epic-subtask hierarchies
- Ensure epic operations integrate with existing FSM rules

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Epics can be created and linked to existing tasks
- [ ] Epic transitions are blocked until all subtasks have completed required steps
- [ ] Event log validation prevents invalid epic transitions
- [ ] CLI commands support epic management operations
- [ ] Board UI clearly shows epic-subtask relationships

### Definition of Done

- Epic functionality is fully implemented and tested
- All epic operations work correctly with existing kanban features
- Comprehensive test coverage for epic scenarios
- Documentation updated with epic usage guidelines
- Team trained on epic functionality
- No performance regression with large epics. An epic should be a special type of task that can contain linked subtasks.\n\n**Core Requirements:**\n- Epic task type with ability to link/unlink subtasks\n- Operations: add-task, remove-task to manage subtask relationships\n- Transition validation: epics can only transition when all linked subtasks have passed through the same workflow steps\n- Event log integration for validation of subtask transitions\n- Epic status reflects aggregate status of linked subtasks\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n- Extend task schema to include epic/subtask relationships\n- Add epic-specific operations to kanban CLI\n- Implement transition validation logic that checks subtask event logs\n- Update board generation to display epic-subtask hierarchies\n- Ensure epic operations integrate with existing FSM rules\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- Epics can be created and linked to existing tasks\n- Epic transitions are blocked until all subtasks have completed required steps\n- Event log validation prevents invalid epic transitions\n- CLI commands support epic management operations\n- Board UI clearly shows epic-subtask relationships

## 📝 Breakdown Assessment

**⚠️ REQUIRES FURTHER BREAKDOWN** - Score: 8 (too large for implementation)

This epic functionality task is too complex for single implementation:

### Implementation Scope:

- Epic-subtask data model and schema extensions
- CLI operations and transition validation
- Event log integration system
- Board generation updates
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

### Required Subtasks:

1. **Epic Data Model Design** (3 points)
2. **CLI Epic Operations** (3 points)
3. **Transition Validation System** (5 points)
4. **Event Log Integration** (3 points)
5. **Board Display Updates** (2 points)
6. **Testing Suite** (3 points)

### Current Status:

- Comprehensive requirements defined ✅
- Implementation phases planned ✅
- Too large for single implementation ⚠️
- Needs breakdown into implementable slices

### Recommendation:

Return to **accepted** column for breakdown into smaller, implementable tasks.
