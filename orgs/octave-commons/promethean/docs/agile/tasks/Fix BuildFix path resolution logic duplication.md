Critical issue: Path resolution logic is duplicated between constructor and executeBuildFix method in BuildFix provider. This creates inconsistency and potential bugs. Need to consolidate path resolution into a single method and ensure consistent behavior across all operations.

## Status Update (2025-10-19)

- Investigated kanban CLI per process docs; `pnpm kanban search duplicate` currently fails because `packages/kanban/dist/cli.js` is missing. Proceeding with manual task updates.
- Consolidated BuildFix path resolution through a shared resolver reused by the constructor and runtime execution logic.
- Verified `@promethean/benchmark` builds cleanly with TypeScript after the refactor (`pnpm --filter @promethean/benchmark build`).
