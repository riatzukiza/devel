## Context

Implement a comprehensive security layer that intercepts tool executions, validates inputs, and enforces security policies across all plugin operations.

## Key Requirements

- Input validation and sanitization for all tools
- Path traversal prevention and file access control
- Command injection protection
- Resource usage limits and monitoring
- Audit logging for security events
- Configurable security policies
- Integration with event hook system

## Files to Create/Modify

- `packages/opencode-client/src/plugins/security-interceptor.ts` (new)
- `packages/opencode-client/src/security/` (new directory)
- `packages/opencode-client/src/policies/` (new directory)
- `packages/opencode-client/src/validators/` (new directory)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All tool inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] Path traversal attacks prevented
- [ ] Command injection protection implemented
- [ ] Resource usage limits enforced
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging for security events
- [ ] Configurable security policies supported
- [ ] Seamless integration with hook system

## Dependencies

- plugin-parity-001-event-driven-hooks

## Notes

This is a critical security component that must protect against common attack vectors while maintaining system performance.
