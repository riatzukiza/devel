## Overview

Implement an automated documentation review system that uses the agents-workflow package to evaluate changed files and their corresponding mirror documentation. The system will score documentation on consistency, clarity, completeness, and conciseness, requiring minimum scores of 8/10 for task completion.

## Current State

Documentation quality is manually assessed and inconsistent across tasks. There's no systematic way to ensure documentation meets project standards before tasks are marked complete.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Evaluation Engine**: Uses `@packages/agents-workflow/src/workflow/` for AI-powered analysis
2. **Scoring System**: Out-of-10 scores for four key metrics
3. **Integration Layer**: Updates task frontmatter with review results
4. **Progressive History**: Maintains review history over time

### Quality Metrics
1. **Consistency** (0-10): Documentation follows project templates and patterns
2. **Clarity** (0-10): Documentation is clear, unambiguous, and easy to understand
3. **Completeness** (0-10): All necessary information is included
4. **Conciseness** (0-10): Information is presented efficiently without unnecessary verbosity

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Evaluation Engine (90 minutes)
1. **Create Documentation Reviewer Agent**
   - Use agents-workflow package to define evaluation workflow
   - Implement evaluation prompts for each quality metric
   - Configure model selection (prefer high-quality models for accuracy)

2. **File Analysis Pipeline**
   - Identify changed files from task implementation
   - Locate corresponding mirror documentation in docs/:code-change
   - Extract content for comparative analysis

3. **Scoring Algorithm**
   - Implement 0-10 scoring for each metric
   - Add confidence intervals and reasoning
   - Ensure consistent scoring across different models

### Phase 2: Integration & Storage (60 minutes)
1. **Frontmatter Integration**
   - Add review scores to task frontmatter
   - Include model name and timestamp
   - Store detailed reasoning in task content

2. **Progressive Review History**
   - Append review sections with timestamp headers
   - Format: `# Documentation review <date:YYYY.MM.DD.hh.mm.ss>`
   - Include model name in both frontmatter and review section

3. **Task Update Workflow**
   - Integrate with kanban task update system
   - Ensure atomic updates to prevent corruption
   - Handle concurrent review processes

### Phase 3: Quality Gates & Enforcement (60 minutes)
1. **Completion Requirements**
   - Enforce 8+ score requirement for all metrics
   - Block task completion if any metric below threshold
   - Provide specific improvement suggestions

2. **Transition Rule Integration**
   - Connect with documentation transition rule from companion task
   - Ensure review runs before document → done transition
   - Handle review failures gracefully

3. **Feedback Loop**
   - Generate actionable improvement suggestions
   - Highlight specific sections needing attention
   - Provide examples of good documentation

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (30 minutes)
1. **Test Scenarios**
   - High-quality documentation (should pass)
   - Low-quality documentation (should fail with specific feedback)
   - Edge cases (missing docs, malformed content, etc.)

2. **Model Consistency**
   - Test with different AI models
   - Ensure scoring consistency
   - Validate reasoning quality

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
packages/agents-workflow/src/workflow/
├── documentation-reviewer.ts     # Main evaluation workflow
├── scoring-prompts.ts           # Evaluation prompts for each metric
└── review-integration.ts        # Task update and storage logic
```

### Frontmatter Schema
```yaml
# Existing fields...
documentation_review:
  model: "gpt-4" # Model used for review
  timestamp: "2025.10.13.16.50.00"
  scores:
    consistency: 8
    clarity: 9
    completeness: 7
    conciseness: 8
  overall_score: 8
  passed: false
```

### Review Section Format
```markdown
# Documentation review 2025.10.13.16.50.00

**Model**: gpt-4  
**Overall Score**: 8/10  
**Status**: ❌ Failed (completeness below threshold)

## Metric Scores

- **Consistency**: 8/10 - Documentation follows project template well
- **Clarity**: 9/10 - Clear and easy to understand
- **Completeness**: 7/10 - Missing implementation details and testing information
- **Conciseness**: 8/10 - Well-structured without unnecessary verbosity

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Add Implementation Details**: Include specific code changes made and their rationale
2. **Include Testing Information**: Document test cases added and their results
3. **Expand Examples**: Provide before/after examples for clarity

### Agent Workflow Definition
```typescript
const documentationReviewWorkflow = {
  id: "documentation-review",
  nodes: [
    {
      id: "file-analyzer",
      definition: {
        instructions: "Analyze changed files and locate corresponding documentation",
        tools: ["file-system", "git-diff"]
      }
    },
    {
      id: "consistency-evaluator",
      definition: {
        instructions: "Evaluate documentation consistency with project standards",
        model: "gpt-4"
      }
    },
    {
      id: "clarity-evaluator", 
      definition: {

        model: "gpt-4"
      }
    },
    {
      id: "completeness-evaluator",
      definition: {
