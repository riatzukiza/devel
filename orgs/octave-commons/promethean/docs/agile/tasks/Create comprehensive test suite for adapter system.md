## Task: Create comprehensive test suite for adapter system\n\n### Description\nDevelop a comprehensive test suite covering all adapter functionality, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for the entire adapter system.\n\n### Requirements\n1. Unit tests for all adapter implementations:\n   - Abstract adapter interface compliance\n   - BoardAdapter parsing and generation\n   - DirectoryAdapter file operations\n   - GitHubAdapter API interactions\n   - TrelloAdapter API interactions\n\n2. Integration tests for adapter combinations:\n   - Board ↔ Directory sync\n   - Board ↔ GitHub sync\n   - Directory ↔ Trello sync\n   - Multi-adapter sync scenarios\n\n3. CLI command tests with adapters:\n   - push/pull/sync with different adapter combinations\n   - Argument parsing and validation\n   - Error handling for invalid adapters\n   - Backward compatibility tests\n\n4. Mock implementations for external APIs:\n   - GitHub API mocking\n   - Trello API mocking\n   - File system mocking\n   - Network error simulation\n\n5. Performance and reliability tests:\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Rate limiting behavior\n   - Concurrent operations\n   - Error recovery scenarios\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Test coverage > 90% for all adapter code\n- Mock implementations for all external dependencies\n- Automated test data setup and cleanup\n- CI/CD integration with test execution\n- Performance benchmarks for adapter operations\n- Documentation for test architecture\n\n### Dependencies\n- Tasks 1-9: All adapter implementations\n- Task 5: CLI command updates\n\n### Priority\nP1 - Critical for system reliability
