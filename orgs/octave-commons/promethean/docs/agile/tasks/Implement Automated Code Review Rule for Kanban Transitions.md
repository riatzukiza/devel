# Implement Automated Code Review Rule for Kanban Transitions

## 🎯 Overview

Implement a new kanban transition rule for the `review → document` transition that automatically runs an agent workflow to perform comprehensive code review. This rule will gather relevant code context, analyze changes, and generate documentation as part of the transition validation process.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] **Transition Rule Integration**: New rule triggers automatically when moving tasks from `review` to `document` status
- [ ] **Agent Workflow Execution**: Runs automated code review workflow using `@promethean-os/agents-workflow` package
- [ ] **Context Gathering**: Collects task body, relevant code chunks via nearest neighbor search, and mentioned files
- [ ] **Git Diff Analysis**: Captures repo diff between commit when task was marked `in_progress` and current working tree
- [ ] **Transition Validation**: Only allows transition to `document` if code review workflow completes successfully

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **Workflow Definition**: Create markdown-based agent workflow for code review using existing agents-workflow infrastructure
- [ ] **Transition Rule Configuration**: Add new rule to `promethean.kanban.json` with appropriate check function
- [ ] **Clojure DSL Integration**: Implement check function in `docs/agile/rules/kanban_transitions.clj`
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with informative error messages
- [ ] **Performance**: Workflow execution should complete within reasonable time limits (≤ 2 minutes)

### Integration Points
- [ ] **Kanban System**: Seamless integration with existing `@promethean-os/kanban` transition rules engine
- [ ] **Agent Workflow**: Utilize `@promethean-os/agents-workflow` for code review automation
- [ ] **Git Integration**: Leverage existing git tools for diff generation and commit tracking
- [ ] **File System**: Use existing file search and indexing capabilities for code context gathering

### Testing & Documentation
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for transition rule logic
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of workflow execution during transitions
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update kanban process documentation with new rule details
- [ ] **Examples**: Provide sample task demonstrating the automated code review workflow

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Agent Workflow Design

Create a new agent workflow definition in markdown format that includes:

**Input Context**:
- Task body and metadata
- Relevant code files (nearest neighbor search)
- Explicitly mentioned files/code blocks
- Git diff between `in_progress` commit and current state

**Agent Pipeline**:
1. **Context Analyzer**: Extract and organize relevant code context
2. **Code Reviewer**: Perform comprehensive code analysis
3. **Documentation Generator**: Create review summaries and documentation
4. **Quality Validator**: Ensure review completeness and quality

**Output**:
- Code review summary
- Generated documentation
- Quality assessment results
- Recommendations for improvements

### 2. Transition Rule Configuration

Update `promethean.kanban.json`:

```json
{
  "from": ["review"],
  "to": ["document"],
  "description": "Run automated code review workflow before documentation",
  "check": "automated-code-review-complete?"
}
```

### 3. Clojure DSL Implementation

Add to `docs/agile/rules/kanban_transitions.clj`:

```clojure
(defn automated-code-review-complete?
  "Check if automated code review workflow completed successfully"
  [task board]
  ;; Implementation details for workflow execution and validation
  )
```

### 4. Integration Architecture

**Workflow Execution Flow**:
1. User attempts `review → document` transition
2. Transition rules engine validates using new check function
3. Check function triggers agents-workflow execution
4. Workflow gathers context and runs code review pipeline
5. Results validate and transition completes or fails with feedback

**Error Handling**:
- Workflow execution timeouts
- Missing context or dependencies
- Invalid code review results
- System integration failures

## 🏗️ Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 days)
- [ ] **Research & Design**: Analyze existing agents-workflow patterns and kanban integration points
- [ ] **Workflow Definition**: Create markdown-based agent workflow for code review
- [ ] **Basic Integration**: Implement simple transition rule with placeholder workflow

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (3-4 days)
- [ ] **Context Gathering**: Implement nearest neighbor search and file extraction logic
- [ ] **Git Integration**: Add diff generation and commit tracking capabilities
- [ ] **Workflow Engine**: Integrate agents-workflow execution with transition rules
- [ ] **Validation Logic**: Implement success/failure criteria for workflow results

### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement (2-3 days)
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and integration points
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with real scenarios
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Ensure workflow execution meets time requirements
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios and recovery

### Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment (1-2 days)
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update process docs and add examples
- [ ] **Migration**: Use migration system for any schema changes
- [ ] **Deployment**: Prepare for production deployment with monitoring

## 🔍 Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Required Components
- `@promethean-os/kanban` - Transition rules engine (existing)
- `@promethean-os/agents-workflow` - Agent workflow execution (existing)
- Git integration tools - For diff generation (existing)
- File search/indexing - For code context gathering (existing)

### External Dependencies
- Code analysis models (via agents-workflow)
- Documentation generation capabilities
- Performance monitoring and logging

### Blocking Items
- None identified - all required infrastructure exists

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- [ ] **Transition Success Rate**: ≥ 95% successful transitions when code is ready
- [ ] **Workflow Completion Time**: ≤ 2 minutes average execution time
- [ ] **Error Rate**: ≤ 5% workflow failures due to system issues

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] **Code Review Coverage**: All relevant files included in review context
- [ ] **Documentation Quality**: Generated docs meet existing standards
- [ ] **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on automated review quality

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Rollout Plan
1. **Feature Flag**: Implement behind feature flag for gradual rollout
2. **Pilot Testing**: Test with specific task types and teams
3. **Gradual Expansion**: Expand to all review → document transitions
4. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of performance and quality

### Monitoring & Observability
- Workflow execution metrics and logs
- Transition success/failure rates
- Performance timing and bottlenecks
- User feedback and satisfaction scores

## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Technical Considerations
- **Performance**: Workflow execution should not block kanban operations excessively
- **Scalability**: Handle multiple concurrent review workflows
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation when workflow services are unavailable
- **Security**: Ensure code context gathering respects access controls

### User Experience
- **Feedback**: Clear error messages and progress indicators
- **Transparency**: Users should understand what the automated review is doing
- **Control**: Ability to override or retry failed reviews when appropriate

### Future Enhancements
- **Customizable Workflows**: Allow teams to define custom review workflows
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Connect with external code review systems
- **Machine Learning**: Improve context gathering and review quality over time
- **Multi-language Support**: Extend beyond TypeScript/JavaScript codebases
