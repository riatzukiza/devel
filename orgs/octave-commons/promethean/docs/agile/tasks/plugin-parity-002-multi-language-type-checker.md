- Configurable language patterns and checker commands
- Real-time error detection and reporting
- Integration with event hooks for automatic checking
- Support for custom language configurations
- Performance optimization with caching
- Comprehensive error reporting with metadata

## Files to Create/Modify

- `packages/opencode-client/src/actions/type-checker/` (new directory)
- `packages/opencode-client/src/factories/type-checker-factory.ts` (new)
- `packages/opencode-client/src/types/language-config.ts` (new)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All target languages supported with proper error detection
- [ ] Configurable checker commands and patterns
- [ ] Real-time checking triggered by file operations
- [ ] Integration with hook system for automatic execution
- [ ] Custom language configurations supported
- [ ] Performance optimized with result caching
- [ ] Rich error reporting with file context and metadata

## Dependencies

- plugin-parity-001-event-driven-hooks

## Notes
