# Add confidence calibration and historical accuracy tracking

## Description
Current LLM confidence scores are not calibrated against actual outcomes. Need historical accuracy tracking and confidence range adjustments based on context quality.

## Proposed Solution
- Track evaluation accuracy against actual task outcomes
- Implement confidence calibration curves per model
- Adjust confidence ranges based on context quality indicators
- Model uncertainty quantification techniques
- Historical performance analytics and reporting

## Benefits
- More reliable confidence scores
- Better decision-making based on calibrated uncertainty
- Identification of model strengths and weaknesses
- Improved trust in automated evaluations
- Data-driven model selection and tuning

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Historical accuracy tracking database
- [ ] Confidence calibration algorithms
- [ ] Context quality assessment metrics
- [ ] Uncertainty quantification methods
- [ ] Performance analytics dashboard
- [ ] Automated calibration updates

## Technical Details
- **Files to modify**: `src/05-evaluate.ts`, `src/06-report.ts`, `src/types.ts`
- **New components**: `AccuracyTracker`, `ConfidenceCalibrator`, `UncertaintyQuantifier`
- **Database**: Extend LevelDB with accuracy tracking namespace
- **Metrics**: Calibration curves, Brier scores, reliability diagrams

## Notes
Requires collection of actual task outcomes over time to build calibration data. Start with simple heuristics and improve as data accumulates.
