## 🚫 Critical: Prevent Invalid Starting Status Creation

### Problem Summary
Kanban CLI allows creating tasks with invalid starting statuses, violating the proper workflow and causing process violations.

### Technical Details
- **Component**: Kanban CLI
- **Issue Type**: Validation Bug
- **Impact**: Workflow violations and process inconsistencies
- **Priority**: P0 (Critical for process compliance)

### Bug Description
The kanban create command currently allows tasks to be created with any status, but tasks should only be created with 'incoming' status to follow proper workflow.

### Breakdown Tasks

#### Phase 1: Investigation (1 hour)
- [ ] Locate kanban create command implementation
- [ ] Identify current status validation logic
- [ ] Document valid starting statuses
- [ ] Plan validation implementation

#### Phase 2: Implementation (1 hour)
- [ ] Add status validation to create command
- [ ] Implement proper error messages
- [ ] Update help text and documentation
- [ ] Ensure validation works for all create methods

#### Phase 3: Testing (1 hour)
- [ ] Create test cases for status validation
- [ ] Test invalid status rejection
- [ ] Verify valid status acceptance
- [ ] Test error message clarity

#### Phase 4: Deployment (1 hour)
- [ ] Deploy validation changes
- [ ] Update CLI documentation
- [ ] Test with existing workflows
- [ ] Monitor for any issues

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tasks can only be created with 'incoming' status
- [ ] Invalid starting statuses are rejected with clear error messages
- [ ] Error messages explain proper workflow
- [ ] No regression in valid task creation
- [ ] Test coverage for validation scenarios

### Definition of Done
- Status validation is fully implemented
- Invalid starting statuses are properly rejected
- Clear error messages guide users to correct workflow
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation updated with validation rules. Tasks should only be created with 'incoming' status, and any attempt to create with other statuses should be rejected with an error message explaining the proper workflow.
