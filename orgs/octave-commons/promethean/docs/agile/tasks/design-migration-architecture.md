# Design Migration Architecture

## 🎯 Task Overview

Design the comprehensive architecture for the kanban process migration system, including deprecation mechanisms, state management, and integration patterns.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Design deprecation and aliasing system architecture
- [ ] Define migration state machine and transition paths
- [ ] Design context enrichment integration points
- [ ] Plan validation and conflict detection strategy
- [ ] Design rollback and recovery mechanisms

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. Deprecation System

```typescript
interface StatusDeprecation {
  oldStatus: string;
  newStatus: string;
  aliasUntil: Date;
  migrationPath: string[];
  operationalGuidance: string;
}
```

### 2. Migration State Manager

```typescript
interface MigrationState {
  id: string;
  status: 'planned' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'rolled_back';
  changes: MigrationChange[];
  rollbackPlan: RollbackPlan;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### 3. Context Enrichment

- File-indexer integration for impact analysis
- Agents-workflow integration for workflow context
- Dependency mapping and visualization

### 4. Validation Engine

- Schema validation for all configuration files
- Transition rule validation
- Impact analysis and conflict detection

## 🔄 Migration Flow

1. **Plan Phase**: Read-only analysis with impact assessment
2. **Validate Phase**: Safety checks and conflict resolution
3. **Execute Phase**: Atomic updates with rollback capability
4. **Verify Phase**: Post-migration validation and cleanup

## 🎯 Definition of Done

Architecture design complete with:

1. Detailed component specifications and interfaces
2. Migration flow documentation with state diagrams
3. Integration patterns for file-indexer and agents-workflow
4. Validation and rollback strategy documentation
5. Technical implementation roadmap
