# Epic: Kanban Process Update & Migration System

## 🎯 Epic Overview

Create a comprehensive kanban process update and migration system that enables smooth evolution of the kanban workflow while maintaining backward compatibility. The system will address the current issue where column names like "todo" conflict with agent `todo` tools and some column names don't work well when delegating tasks to agents.

## 🎯 Epic Goals

1. **Deprecating Status Transitions**: Support deprecating status values with aliasing to new transitions, including operational guidance
2. **Smart Process Updater**: Build intelligent CLI-based process updater with plan/execute modes
3. **Iterative Non-Interactive Design**: Plan-first approach with context enrichment and safe execution
4. **Migration System**: Handle smooth transitions from old status names to new ones while maintaining backward compatibility

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality

- [ ] CLI command `kanban process update <status-name>` with plan/execute modes
- [ ] Deprecation system with aliasing and migration paths
- [ ] Context enrichment using file-indexer and agents-workflow systems
- [ ] Safe, iterative updates with rollback capability
- [ ] Comprehensive validation and conflict detection

### Integration Requirements

- [ ] Updates `docs/agile/process.md` with new FSM rules
- [ ] Updates `promethean.kanban.json` with new status values and transitions
- [ ] Updates `docs/agile/rules/kanban_transitions.clj` with new transition logic
- [ ] Uses `packages/file-indexer/` for file context and impact analysis
- [ ] Uses `packages/agents-workflow/` for workflow system integration

### Quality & Safety

- [ ] Plan mode shows all changes before execution
- [ ] Validation prevents breaking changes
- [ ] Rollback capability for failed updates
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and audit trail
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained during transition

## 🏗️ Proposed Column Name Changes

Based on the conflict analysis, these column names need updates:

| Current Name  | Issue                              | Proposed Name | Rationale               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| `todo`        | Conflicts with agent `todo` tool   | `backlog`     | Clear queue terminology |
| `in_progress` | Underscore issues in some contexts | `active`      | Cleaner, agent-friendly |
| `icebox`      | Ambiguous meaning                  | `deferred`    | Clearer intent          |
| `incoming`    | Generic term                       | `triage`      | More specific purpose   |
