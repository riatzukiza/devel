# Kanban In-Progress Tasks Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Auditor:** Kanban Process Enforcer  
**Scope:** All tasks currently in "in_progress" status

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL PROCESS VIOLATIONS DETECTED:** 3/3 in-progress tasks are non-compliant with established kanban process flow.

All three tasks have skipped mandatory process stages and lack required documentation elements, representing a systematic breakdown in process adherence.

## Tasks Analyzed

### 1. Task: Fix `@promethean-os/ui-components` lint failures (f4e15fe7-e616-4e34-94a6-a4ca655f4f4c)
**Status:** in_progress  
**Priority:** P2  
**Labels:** ["codex-task"]

#### Process Violations:
- **❌ SKIPPED BREAKDOWN & ESTIMATE STAGE**: No Fibonacci complexity score (1,2,3,5,8,13) assigned
- **❌ SKIPPED READY GATE**: No evidence of passing ready gate validation
- **❌ MISSING ESTIMATES**: All estimate fields (complexity, scale, time_to_completion) are empty
- **❌ UNCLEAR WORKFLOW**: Task shows completed acceptance criteria but remains in in_progress

#### Compliance Issues:
- Task appears to have completed work (all acceptance criteria marked as done) but hasn't progressed to In Review
- No documented evidence of moving through proper stages (Todo → In Progress)
- Missing required complexity scoring for work sizing

#### Required Actions:
1. Move to In Review immediately since work appears complete
2. Retroactively document complexity score (appears to be 3-5 based on scope)
3. Add missing estimates to maintain process integrity

### 2. Task: MCP stdio proxy: code review + minimal hardening (3c3a6f8b-2a8d-4b3e-8d63-2b7d1e8f7a91)
**Status:** in_progress  
**Priority:** P2  
**Labels:** ["bugfix", "mcp", "proxy", "stdio"]

#### Process Violations:
- **❌ SKIPPED BREAKDOWN & ESTIMATE STAGE**: No Fibonacci complexity score assigned
- **❌ SKIPPED READY GATE**: No validation of work size vs session capacity
- **❌ MISSING ESTIMATES**: All estimate fields are empty
- **❌ IMPROPER BLOCKING**: Task lists blockers but should be in Blocked status per FSM rules

#### Compliance Issues:
- Task has dependencies that should trigger Blocked status per FSM rules
- No complexity scoring despite having multiple sub-components and technical challenges
- Mixed completion state (some AC done, some pending) without clear next steps

#### Required Actions:
1. Move to Blocked status immediately due to explicit dependencies
2. Document complexity score (appears to be 8+ based on multiple components)
3. Consider splitting into smaller slices if score >5
4. Add proper estimates for remaining work

### 3. Task: Shadow CLJS migration — step 1 foundation (7a1a45fb-51d3-4d7b-b143-3834cf8aad3c)
**Status:** in_progress  
**Priority:** P2  
**Labels:** ["codex-task", "framework-core", "frontend"]

#### Process Violations:
- **❌ SKIPPED BREAKDOWN & ESTIMATE STAGE**: No Fibonacci complexity score in estimates
- **❌ SKIPPED READY GATE**: No validation of work sizing
- **❌ MISSING ESTIMATES**: All estimate fields empty despite having "Estimate: 5" in content
- **❌ INCONSISTENT DOCUMENTATION**: Estimate mentioned in body but not in structured estimates field

#### Compliance Issues:
- Complexity estimate (5) exists in content but not in structured estimates field
- Task appears to be in early planning phase but marked as in_progress
- No evidence of passing through Todo → In Progress transition

#### Required Actions:
1. Move estimate "5" to structured estimates.complexity field
2. Validate if task should be in Todo or Ready status based on actual progress
3. Complete breakdown stage with proper scoring

## Systemic Issues Identified

### 1. Process Stage Skipping
All three tasks have bypassed the mandatory **Breakdown & Estimate** stage, which is critical for:
- Work sizing and capacity planning
- Risk assessment and complexity scoring
- Ensuring tasks fit within session constraints

### 2. Missing Complexity Scoring
None of the tasks have Fibonacci complexity scores, violating the core principle that:
- Scores >5 must be split further
- Scores ≤5 are eligible for implementation
- Scores provide input for WIP management

### 3. Improper Status Management
- Tasks appear to be in wrong lifecycle stages
- Blocked dependencies not properly reflected in status
- Completed work not progressing through review pipeline

### 4. Documentation Inconsistency
- Estimates mentioned in content but not in structured fields
- Acceptance criteria mixed with implementation notes
- No clear evidence of stage transitions

## Immediate Corrective Actions Required

### High Priority (Within 24 hours):
1. **Move UI Components task to In Review** - Work appears complete
2. **Move MCP Proxy task to Blocked** - Has explicit dependencies
3. **Re-evaluate Shadow CLJS task status** - May belong in Todo/Ready

### Medium Priority (Within 48 hours):
1. **Add complexity scores** to all tasks using Fibonacci sequence
2. **Populate structured estimates** fields for proper tracking
3. **Document stage transitions** for audit trail
4. **Validate WIP compliance** with proper task sizing

### Process Improvement Actions:
1. **Implement automated validation** for required fields before status changes
2. **Add stage transition requirements** to kanban CLI
3. **Enhance process training** for agents on FSM compliance
4. **Regular compliance audits** to prevent recurrence

## Impact Assessment

**Risk Level:** HIGH
- 100% non-compliance rate indicates systemic process breakdown
- Missing complexity scoring impacts capacity planning
- Improper status management affects workflow visibility
- Potential for WIP limit violations and bottlenecks

**Business Impact:**
- Reduced predictability in delivery timelines
- Increased risk of oversized work items
- Poor visibility into actual work progress
- Potential for quality issues due to rushed work

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Process Enforcement**: Halt new in-progress work until compliance achieved
2. **Automated Validation**: Implement pre-commit checks for required fields
3. **Agent Training**: Reinforce FSM rules and stage requirements
4. **Regular Audits**: Schedule weekly compliance reviews
5. **Process Documentation**: Enhance clarity on stage requirements

## Conclusion

The current state represents a significant process compliance failure requiring immediate attention. All three in-progress tasks must be brought into compliance before proceeding with additional work to maintain workflow integrity and delivery predictability.
