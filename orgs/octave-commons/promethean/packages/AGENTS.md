# AGENTS.md

Folder purpose: reusable @promethean-os/\* libraries consumed by services, CLIs, and experiments. Most new work now lives under `cli/`, `services/`, or `experimental/`; this folder holds shared/legacy libraries still in-repo with docs under `docs/packages/<slug>/`.

## Module Resolution

- Do not resolve modules via relative paths outside of a package's root.
- Shared types must be provided by dependencies (e.g., `"@promethean-os/packagename": "workspace:*"`).
- "@node/types" is installed at package root.
- node version is pinned by package.json

## Package scaffolding

Many libraries here are vendored submodules; prefer updating their upstream repos when `.git` or `.gitrepo` is present. Add new packages here only when they cannot live under `cli/`, `services/`, or `experimental/`.

- Use Nx to create new workspace packages:
  - Libraries: `nx g tools:package <name> --preset library`
  - Fastify services: `nx g tools:package <name> --preset service`
  - Frontends: `nx g tools:package <name> --preset frontend`
- The generator writes `src/` with functional TypeScript entry points, AVA stubs in `src/tests`, and `static/` for assets that should be served by `@fastify/static`.
- Service presets include an OpenAPI template under `static/openapi`, and you must expose it through `/openapi.json` using `@fastify/swagger` and `@fastify/swagger-ui`.
- Frontend presets emit `src/frontend/` alongside `dist/frontend/` targets; serve `dist/frontend` and `static` together from Fastify when deploying UI shells.
- All packages compile to `dist/` with ESM outputs that keep `.js` extensions in import statements.
- Every package stays GPL-3.0-only and follows our functional TypeScript conventions (pure functions, immutability, composition).

## Testing

- Ava is always the test runner (tests live in `src/tests`).
- Test logic does not belong in module logic
- define **ports** (your own minimal interfaces),
- provide **adapters** for external services like Mongo/Chroma/level/redis/sql/etc,
- have a **composition root** that wires real adapters in prod,
- and in tests either inject fakes directly or **mock at the module boundary** (ESM-safe) without touching business code.
- **No test code in prod paths.** Ports/DI keeps boundaries explicit.
- **Deterministic & parallel-friendly.** No shared module singletons leaking between tests.
- **Easier refactors.** Adapters are the only place that knows Mongo/Chroma APIs.
- **Right tool for each test level.** Fakes for unit speed; containers for realistic integration. The principle is well-established: mock _your_ interfaces, not vendor clients. ([Hynek Schlawack][3], [8th Light][2])
- `esmock` provides native ESM import mocking and has examples for AVA. It avoids invasive “test hook” exports. ([NPM][5], [Skypack][6])

## Clean Code

- Leave every file you touch a bit cleaner than you found it.
- Run eslint on changed paths and fix violations instead of ignoring them.
- Prefer small, incremental improvements to code quality.

## Example package

Keep it simple, use barrel exports, minimal tsconfig extending `../../tsconfig.base.json`, minimal `ava.config.mjs`
build essentials (`typescript`, `rimraf`, `eslint`,`prettier`,`ts-node`,`ava`,`tsx`, etc) are pinned to the root ``package.json`
to prevent version drift.

node versions are pinned to root `package.json` to prevent version drift.
