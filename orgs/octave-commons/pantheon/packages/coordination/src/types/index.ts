/**
 * Agent Coordination System Types
 *
 * Unified type system for agent instance management, task assignment,
 * and real-time coordination in Pantheon (formerly called Agent OS).
 *
 * We only expose the base agent instance primitives at the top level to
 * avoid duplicate symbol collisions across the more specialized modules.
 * Use the exported namespaces for the full surface area.
