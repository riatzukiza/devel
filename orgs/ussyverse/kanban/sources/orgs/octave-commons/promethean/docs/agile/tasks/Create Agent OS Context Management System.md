## 🧠 Critical: Agent OS Context Management System

### Problem Summary

Agent OS lacks a robust context management system for maintaining conversation state, agent awareness, and information persistence across interactions.

### Technical Details

- **Component**: Agent OS Core
- **Feature Type**: Foundational Infrastructure
- **Impact**: Critical for agent coordination and memory
- **Priority**: P0 (Critical infrastructure)

### Scope

- Design context data structures and storage
- Implement context propagation between messages
- Create context lifecycle management (creation, updates, expiration)
- Add context sharing between agents

### Breakdown Tasks

#### Phase 1: Context Design (3 hours)

- [ ] Design context data model and schema
- [ ] Plan context storage architecture
- [ ] Design context lifecycle management
- [ ] Plan context sharing mechanisms
- [ ] Create privacy and security model

#### Phase 2: Core Implementation (6 hours)

- [ ] Implement context storage backend
- [ ] Create context management API
- [ ] Implement context propagation logic
- [ ] Add context lifecycle management
- [ ] Create context sharing system
- [ ] Implement context querying and filtering

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (3 hours)

- [ ] Create context management test suite
- [ ] Test context persistence and retrieval
- [ ] Verify context sharing between agents
- [ ] Test context lifecycle management
- [ ] Performance testing with large contexts

#### Phase 4: Integration & Security (2 hours)

- [ ] Integrate with message protocol
- [ ] Implement privacy controls
- [ ] Add context security measures
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Conduct security review

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Context persists across related message exchanges
- [ ] Context can be shared between multiple agents
- [ ] Context has proper lifecycle management and cleanup
- [ ] Context includes relevant metadata (timestamps, participants, topics)
- [ ] Context can be queried and filtered efficiently

### Technical Requirements

- Efficient context storage and retrieval
- Support for hierarchical context structures
- Context versioning and history tracking
- Privacy controls for sensitive context data

### Definition of Done

- Context management system is fully implemented
- Context persists and shares correctly between agents
- Comprehensive test coverage for all context operations
- Privacy and security measures are in place
- Documentation updated with context usage guidelines
- Performance benchmarks met for large-scale context operations\n\n**Scope:**\n- Design context data structures and storage\n- Implement context propagation between messages\n- Create context lifecycle management (creation, updates, expiration)\n- Add context sharing between agents\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] Context persists across related message exchanges\n- [ ] Context can be shared between multiple agents\n- [ ] Context has proper lifecycle management and cleanup\n- [ ] Context includes relevant metadata (timestamps, participants, topics)\n- [ ] Context can be queried and filtered efficiently\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n- Efficient context storage and retrieval\n- Support for hierarchical context structures\n- Context versioning and history tracking\n- Privacy controls for sensitive context data\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- Design Agent OS Core Message Protocol\n\n**Labels:** agent-os,context,management,state,persistence,critical
