## 📋 Context

Implemented comprehensive test coverage for MCP files endpoints including unit tests, integration tests, and edge case testing. This was in response to security fixes for symlink escape vulnerabilities.

## 🔧 Work Completed

### Test Coverage Created
- **Unit Tests** (`files-tools.test.ts`): Comprehensive tests for all 6 files tools
- **Integration Tests** (`files-tools-integration.test.ts`): Full MCP protocol testing with server/client communication  
- **Edge Case Tests** (`files-tools-edgecases.test.ts`): Boundary conditions and unusual scenarios

### Security Enhancements
- Enhanced symlink validation in `files.ts` with `validatePathSecurity` function
- Comprehensive sandbox escape prevention
- Path traversal protection improvements

### Test Features
- Temporary directory management with cleanup
- Mock data creation for testing scenarios
- MCP protocol communication testing
- Session management and concurrent request handling
- Large file handling and special character processing
- Input validation and error handling

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Created comprehensive unit test coverage for all files tools
- [x] Implemented integration tests with full MCP protocol
- [x] Added edge case testing for boundary conditions
- [x] Enhanced security with symlink validation
- [x] Tests handle both positive and negative scenarios
- [x] Proper cleanup and resource management

## 🔗 Related Work

- Enhanced `packages/mcp/src/files.ts` with security improvements
- Added test infrastructure in `packages/mcp/src/tests/`
- Security validation for sandbox prevention

## 📊 Impact

The MCP files endpoints are now thoroughly tested with comprehensive coverage including security scenarios, edge cases, and integration testing. This ensures robust functionality and prevents sandbox escape vulnerabilities.
