The indexer-core uses global mutable state (CHROMA, EMBEDDING_FACTORY, etc.) which makes testing difficult, causes race conditions, and violates functional programming principles.\n\n**Global state issues:**\n- Global variables make unit testing impossible\n- Race conditions in concurrent scenarios\n- Difficult to mock dependencies for testing\n- Violates functional programming preferences\n- Makes code harder to reason about\n\n**Refactoring approach:**\n- Create IndexerContext class to manage state\n- Implement dependency injection pattern\n- Pass context to functions instead of using globals\n- Add factory functions for creating configured instances\n- Maintain backward compatibility during transition\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Improved testability with mockable dependencies\n- Better thread safety and concurrency handling\n- Cleaner separation of concerns\n- Easier configuration management\n- Alignment with functional programming goals\n\n**Files affected:**\n- packages/indexer-core/src/indexer.ts (major refactoring)\n- Add context and factory modules\n\n**Priority:** MEDIUM - Architecture improvement
