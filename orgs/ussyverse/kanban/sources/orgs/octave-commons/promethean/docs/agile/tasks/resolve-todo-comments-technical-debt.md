## Description

The codebase contains 33 TODO comments representing technical debt across various components. These include adapter type issues in omni-service, Ollama integration problems, and incomplete LMDB integration that need resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audit all 33 TODO comments and categorize by priority and complexity
- [ ] Resolve high-priority TODOs related to adapter type issues in omni-service
- [ ] Complete Ollama integration TODOs and ensure proper functionality
- [ ] Finish LMDB integration implementation or remove incomplete code
- [ ] Replace remaining TODO comments with proper implementations or documented decisions
- [ ] Add technical debt tracking for any items that cannot be immediately resolved

## Technical Details

**TODO Categories Identified:**

1. **Adapter Type Issues (omni-service)** - High Priority

   - Type definitions for various adapters
   - Interface compatibility issues
   - Generic type constraints

2. **Ollama Integration Problems** - Medium Priority

   - Connection handling
   - Error recovery
   - Response parsing

3. **LMDB Integration** - Medium Priority

   - Database schema definitions
   - Transaction handling
   - Performance optimizations

4. **Miscellaneous TODOs** - Low Priority
   - Code documentation
   - Minor feature enhancements
   - Performance optimizations

**Resolution Strategy:**

1. **Immediate Resolution (P0-P1):**

   - Critical adapter type issues blocking functionality
   - Security-related TODOs
   - Build-blocking items

2. **Planned Resolution (P2):**

   - Feature-complete TODOs with clear requirements
   - Integration improvements

3. **Deferred (P3):**
   - Nice-to-have enhancements
   - Documentation improvements

## Dependencies

- May depend on type safety improvements in omni-service
- May require coordination with Ollama and LMDB integration teams

## Risk Assessment

**Medium Risk:** Some TODOs may require significant architectural changes
**Mitigation:** Prioritize by impact and implement incrementally
