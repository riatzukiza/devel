## 🛡️ Critical Security: MCP Security Hardening & Validation

### Problem Summary
MCP-kanban integration lacks comprehensive security measures and input validation, creating multiple attack vectors for malicious actors.

### Technical Details
- **Component**: MCP-kanban Bridge API
- **Vulnerability Types**: Input Validation, Missing Security Headers, Insufficient Logging
- **Impact**: Multiple security vulnerabilities
- **Risk Level**: Critical (P0)

### Scope
- Implement input sanitization for all MCP operations
- Add rate limiting and abuse prevention for MCP endpoints
- Create comprehensive audit logging for security events
- Implement secure file handling for MCP file operations

### Breakdown Tasks

#### Phase 1: Security Analysis (2 hours)
- [ ] Audit all MCP endpoints for security gaps
- [ ] Identify input validation requirements
- [ ] Plan rate limiting strategy
- [ ] Design audit logging framework
- [ ] Document security requirements

#### Phase 2: Security Implementation (5 hours)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Add rate limiting and abuse prevention
- [ ] Create security middleware (CORS, headers, etc.)
- [ ] Implement secure file handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Sanitize error messages to prevent info leakage

#### Phase 3: Security Testing (3 hours)
- [ ] Create security test suite
- [ ] Test input validation bypasses
- [ ] Verify rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Test audit logging completeness
- [ ] Perform penetration testing

#### Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring (2 hours)
- [ ] Deploy security hardening measures
- [ ] Configure security monitoring
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Conduct security review
- [ ] Team security training

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All MCP inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- [ ] Security events are logged with proper detail
- [ ] File operations are sandboxed and validated
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

### Security Requirements
- Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper CORS and security headers
- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring

### Definition of Done
- All security vulnerabilities are addressed
- Comprehensive input validation is in place
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention working
- Complete audit logging implemented
- Security team approval obtained
- Documentation updated with security guidelines\n\n**Scope:**\n- Implement input sanitization for all MCP operations\n- Add rate limiting and abuse prevention for MCP endpoints\n- Create comprehensive audit logging for security events\n- Implement secure file handling for MCP file operations\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] All MCP inputs are validated and sanitized\n- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse and DoS attacks\n- [ ] Security events are logged with proper detail\n- [ ] File operations are sandboxed and validated\n- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information\n\n**Security Requirements:**\n- Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal\n- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks\n- Implement proper CORS and security headers\n- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- Create MCP-Kanban Bridge API\n\n**Labels:** mcp,kanban,security,validation,hardening,critical
