## 📁 Critical: DirectoryAdapter for Task File Operations

### Problem Summary

Kanban system needs a DirectoryAdapter to handle reading/writing tasks from markdown files, serving as the default source adapter for task persistence.

### Technical Details

- **Component**: Kanban Adapter System
- **Feature Type**: Core Infrastructure
- **Impact**: Critical for task persistence and file operations
- **Priority**: P0 (Required for basic functionality)

### Requirements

1. Create DirectoryAdapter class extending BaseAdapter
2. Implement all required KanbanAdapter interface methods:

   - readTasks(): Scan directory and parse all .md task files
   - writeTasks(): Write/update task files in directory
   - detectChanges(): Compare directory state with other adapter tasks
   - applyChanges(): Create/update/delete task files based on sync changes
   - validateLocation(): Check if directory exists and is accessible
   - initialize(): Create directory if it doesn't exist

3. Handle task file parsing with frontmatter extraction
4. Manage file naming conventions and slug generation
5. Support task creation, updates, and deletion
6. Handle duplicate file detection and resolution
7. Add proper error handling for file system operations

### Breakdown Tasks

#### Phase 1: Design (1 hour)

- [ ] Design DirectoryAdapter class structure
- [ ] Plan file scanning and parsing logic
- [ ] Design error handling strategy
- [ ] Plan integration with BaseAdapter

#### Phase 2: Implementation (4 hours)

- [ ] Implement DirectoryAdapter class
- [ ] Add file scanning and parsing
- [ ] Implement task file writing
- [ ] Add change detection logic
- [ ] Create file management utilities
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

#### Phase 3: Testing (2 hours)

- [ ] Create unit tests for file operations
- [ ] Test task file parsing
- [ ] Test change detection
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

#### Phase 4: Integration (1 hour)

- [ ] Integrate with existing kanban system
- [ ] Test with real task files
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Performance validation

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] DirectoryAdapter implemented in packages/kanban/src/adapters/directory-adapter.ts
- [ ] Successfully reads all existing task files from docs/agile/tasks/
- [ ] Properly handles task file frontmatter parsing
- [ ] Supports creating new task files with proper naming
- [ ] Handles task updates and deletions
- [ ] Unit tests for directory scanning and file operations
- [ ] Integration tests with existing task files

### Dependencies

- Task 1: Abstract KanbanAdapter interface and base class

### Definition of Done

- DirectoryAdapter is fully implemented and tested
- All file operations work correctly
- Integration with kanban system complete
- Comprehensive test coverage
