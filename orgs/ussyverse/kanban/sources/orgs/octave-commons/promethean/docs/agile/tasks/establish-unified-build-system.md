## 🔨 Establish Unified Build System

### 📋 Description

Create a unified build system that can compile TypeScript, ClojureScript, and Electron components within the `@promethean-os/opencode-unified` package. This build system must support development workflows with hot reload and production optimizations for deployment.

### 🎯 Goals

- Single build command for all components
- Development server with hot reload for all languages
- Production build optimization and bundling
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Cross-platform Electron builds

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Single build command that compiles all components
- [x] Development server with hot reload for TypeScript and ClojureScript
- [x] Production build with optimizations and minification
- [x] Electron packaging for multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [x] Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Build caching and incremental compilation
- [x] Error reporting and build diagnostics

### 🔧 Technical Specifications

#### Build System Components:

1. **TypeScript Compilation**

   - Use `tsc` with project references
   - Support for multiple tsconfig files
   - Incremental compilation and caching
   - Source map generation for debugging

2. **ClojureScript Compilation**

   - shadow-cljs integration with multiple builds
   - Development server with hot reload
   - Production optimizations
   - Source map support

3. **Electron Integration**

   - Main process compilation (TypeScript)
   - Renderer process compilation (ClojureScript)
   - Asset bundling and optimization
   - Platform-specific packaging

4. **Development Server**
   - Hot reload for all components
   - Live reloading for Electron
   - Proxy configuration for API calls
   - Development tools integration

#### Build Scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "pnpm run build:ts && pnpm run build:cljs",
    "build:ts": "tsc --build",
    "build:cljs": "shadow-cljs release app",
    "dev": "concurrently \"pnpm dev:ts\" \"pnpm dev:cljs\" \"pnpm dev:electron\"",
    "dev:ts": "tsc --build --watch",
    "dev:cljs": "shadow-cljs watch app",
    "dev:electron": "electron .",
    "build:electron": "electron-builder",
    "test": "pnpm test:ts && pnpm test:cljs",
    "clean": "rimraf dist && shadow-cljs clean"
  }
}
```

### 📁 Files/Components to Create

#### Build Configuration:

1. **`packages/opencode-unified/tsconfig.json`**

   - Main TypeScript configuration
   - Project references for different components
   - Build options for development and production

2. **`packages/opencode-unified/tsconfig.build.json`**

   - Production-specific TypeScript configuration
   - Optimizations and strict settings

3. **`packages/opencode-unified/shadow-cljs.edn`**

   - ClojureScript build configurations
   - Development and production builds
   - Source map and optimization settings

4. **`packages/opencode-unified/electron-builder.json`**

   - Electron packaging configuration
   - Platform-specific build settings
   - Asset and resource management

5. **`packages/opencode-unified/webpack.config.js`** (if needed)
   - Bundling configuration for renderer process
   - Asset optimization and loading

#### Development Tools:

1. **`packages/opencode-unified/.vscode/`**

   - VS Code configuration for multi-language development
   - Debug configurations for TypeScript and ClojureScript

2. **`packages/opencode-unified/.gitignore`**
   - Build output and dependency exclusions
   - Platform-specific ignores

### 🧪 Testing Requirements

- [ ] All TypeScript files compile without errors
- [ ] ClojureScript builds complete successfully
- [ ] Development server starts and serves all components
- [ ] Hot reload works for both languages
- [ ] Production builds are optimized and functional
- [ ] Electron packaging works on target platforms
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration tests pass
