## 🛠️ Task: Fix readmes pipeline timeout issues and optimize performance

## 🐛 Problem Statement

The readmes pipeline consistently times out after 2 minutes during execution, preventing automatic README generation for packages. The pipeline appears to hang during AI model interactions for README content generation.

## 🎯 Desired Outcome

The readmes pipeline should complete within reasonable time (under 5 minutes) and:
- Generate comprehensive README files for all packages
- Use AI models efficiently without unnecessary delays
- Include proper package documentation with mermaid diagrams
- Handle timeouts gracefully and provide progress feedback

## 📋 Requirements

### Phase 1: Performance Analysis
- [ ] Identify which pipeline step is causing timeouts
- [ ] Analyze AI model response times and bottlenecks
- [ ] Check for infinite loops or blocking operations
- [ ] Review network connectivity to OLLAMA service

### Phase 2: Timeout Configuration
- [ ] Add appropriate timeout values to pipeline steps
- [ ] Implement progress reporting for long-running operations
- [ ] Add retry logic for AI model failures
- [ ] Configure concurrent processing limits

### Phase 3: AI Optimization
- [ ] Optimize prompts for faster AI responses
- [ ] Implement caching for repeated AI calls
- [ ] Add fallback options when AI models are unavailable
- [ ] Use smaller, faster models for simple operations

### Phase 4: Pipeline Testing
- [ ] Run individual pipeline steps to isolate issues
- [ ] Test with different AI models and configurations
- [ ] Verify pipeline completion within acceptable time limits
- [ ] Validate generated README quality

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Files to Check/Update
1. **pipelines.json** - Add timeout configurations to readmes steps
2. **packages/readmeflow/** - Review AI interaction code
3. **scripts/** - Check for any timeout handling
4. **Environment configuration** - Verify OLLAMA_URL and model availability

### Expected Pipeline Timeout Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "readmes",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "rm-scan",
      "timeout": 30000
    },
    {
      "id": "rm-outline",
      "timeout": 120000,
      "env": { "OLLAMA_URL": "{OLLAMA_URL}" }
    },
    {
      "id": "rm-write",
      "timeout": 180000,
      "env": { "OLLAMA_URL": "{OLLAMA_URL}" }
    },
    {
      "id": "rm-verify",
      "timeout": 60000
    }
  ]
}
```

### Performance Optimization Strategies
1. **Prompt Optimization**: Use concise, specific prompts
2. **Model Selection**: Use faster models for simple tasks
3. **Caching**: Cache AI responses for repeated requests
4. **Batching**: Process multiple packages efficiently
5. **Progress Reporting**: Show user progress during long operations

### Pipeline Steps That Should Work
1. **rm-scan** - Scan packages for README needs (30s)
2. **rm-outline** - Generate README outlines using AI (2m)
3. **rm-write** - Write full README content (3m)
4. **rm-verify** - Verify generated READMEs (1m)

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

1. **Pipeline Completion**: `pnpm exec piper run readmes` completes within 5 minutes
2. **Progress Feedback**: Users see progress during long-running operations
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of AI model timeouts
4. **Quality Output**: Generated READMEs are comprehensive and accurate
5. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for transient AI model failures
6. **Resource Usage**: Pipeline doesn't hang or consume excessive resources

- **Pipeline Definition**: `pipelines.json` - readmes section
- **Readmeflow Package**: `packages/readmeflow/`
- **AI Model Configuration**: OLLAMA_URL environment variable
- **Output Directory**: Package README files in each package directory
- **Verification Reports**: `docs/agile/reports/readmes/`

## 📝 Technical Notes

The readmes pipeline is crucial for maintaining consistent documentation across the monorepo. It should:
- Analyze package structure and dependencies
- Generate appropriate documentation sections
- Include mermaid diagrams for visual representations
- Verify generated content meets quality standards

Common timeout causes may include:
- Slow AI model responses
- Large package processing
- Network connectivity issues
- Infinite loops in processing logic
- Insufficient timeout configurations

This fix will ensure reliable README generation for all packages, improving developer experience and documentation consistency.
