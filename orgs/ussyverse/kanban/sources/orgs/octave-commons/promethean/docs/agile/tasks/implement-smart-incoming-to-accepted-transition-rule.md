# Implement Smart Incoming → Accepted Transition Rule with AI-Powered Task Quality Analysis

## 🎯 Objective

Implement an intelligent transition rule for the `incoming → accepted` kanban transition that uses AI-powered analysis to evaluate task quality, coherence, and readiness before allowing tasks to enter the planning workflow. This serves as the first quality gate in the Promethean Framework, ensuring only well-defined tasks proceed to breakdown and execution.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] **AI-Powered Task Analysis**: Implement agent workflow that scores task body and filename using agents-workflow package
- [ ] **Global Context Analysis**: Analyze task against globally related documents from the codebase for relevance assessment
- [ ] **Multi-Criteria Scoring System**: Implement comprehensive scoring based on:
  - **Coherence** (1-10): Task clarity, logical structure, and understandability
  - **Feasibility** (1-10): Technical viability and resource requirements
  - **Relevance** (1-10): Alignment with project goals and current priorities
  - **Value Added** (1-10): Expected impact and benefit to the framework
  - **Urgency** (1-10): Time sensitivity and priority alignment
- [ ] **Intelligent Transition Rules**:
  - **Hard Block**: Average score below 6.0 - cannot transition, requires improvement
  - **Soft Block**: Average score below 8.0 - blocked on first attempt with warning, allowed second time
  - **Auto-Accept**: Average score 8.0+ - immediate transition allowed

### Technical Integration
- [ ] **Seamless Kanban Integration**: Integrate with existing `TransitionRulesEngine` in `packages/kanban/src/lib/transition-rules.ts`
- [ ] **Agents-Workflow Integration**: Leverage `@promethean-os/agents-workflow` for AI-powered analysis
- [ ] **Codebase Context Analysis**: Use existing indexer and search capabilities for global context
- [ ] **Unstructured Input Handling**: Gracefully handle varying levels of task definition quality
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Complete analysis within 10 seconds for typical tasks

### Documentation & Reporting
- [ ] **Comprehensive Rationale**: Provide detailed reasoning for overall score and each sub-score
- [ ] **Task Enhancement**: Append analysis report to task with standardized heading format
- [ ] **Constructive Feedback**: Include specific improvement suggestions for blocked tasks
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete analysis history for quality tracking

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage for scoring algorithms and analysis components
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test with real kanban board transitions and various task formats
- [ ] **Edge Case Handling**: Handle empty tasks, malformed content, and analysis failures
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Validate under concurrent load and large task volumes

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Task Quality Analysis Interface

```typescript
interface TaskQualityAnalysis {
  taskId: string;
  overallScore: number; // 1-10 average
  criteria: {
    coherence: CriterionScore;
    feasibility: CriterionScore;
    relevance: CriterionScore;
    valueAdded: CriterionScore;
    urgency: CriterionScore;
  };
  rationale: {
    overall: string;
    criteria: Record<string, string>;
  };
  recommendations: string[];
  canTransition: boolean;
  transitionType: 'hard-block' | 'soft-block' | 'auto-accept';
  analysisMetadata: {
    timestamp: string;
    analysisVersion: string;
    processingTime: number;
    contextSources: string[];
  };
}

interface CriterionScore {
  score: number; // 1-10
  rationale: string;
  evidence: string[];
  confidence: number; // 0-1
}
```

### 2. AI Analysis Workflow

#### Agents-Workflow Integration
```typescript
// Define analysis workflow using agents-workflow package
const taskAnalysisWorkflow = `
# Task Quality Analysis Workflow

## Agents
1. **Coherence Analyst**: Evaluates task clarity, structure, and logical flow
2. **Feasibility Assessor**: Analyzes technical viability and resource requirements
3. **Relevance Evaluator**: Assesses alignment with project goals and priorities
4. **Value Analyst**: Estimates impact and benefit to the framework
5. **Urgency Reviewer**: Evaluates time sensitivity and priority alignment

## Process
1. Parse task content and extract key information
2. Query global codebase context for relevance assessment
3. Run parallel analysis by each agent
4. Aggregate scores and generate comprehensive rationale
5. Provide specific improvement recommendations
6. Generate final transition recommendation
`;
```

#### Global Context Analysis
```typescript
interface ContextAnalysisRequest {
  taskTitle: string;
  taskContent: string;
  taskTags: string[];
  priority: string;
}

interface ContextAnalysisResult {
  relatedDocuments: Array<{
    path: string;
    relevanceScore: number;
    keyPoints: string[];
  }>;
  projectAlignment: number; // 0-1
  priorityAlignment: number; // 0-1
  duplicateTasks: Array<{
    taskId: string;
    similarity: number;
    overlapReason: string;
  }>;
}
```

### 3. Scoring Algorithm Implementation

```typescript
class TaskQualityScorer {
  async analyzeTask(task: Task, board: Board): Promise<TaskQualityAnalysis> {
    // 1. Extract and normalize task information

    // 2. Analyze global context
    const context = await this.analyzeGlobalContext(taskInfo);
    
    // 3. Run AI-powered criteria analysis
    const criteria = await this.analyzeCriteria(taskInfo, context);
    
    // 4. Calculate overall score
    const overallScore = this.calculateOverallScore(criteria);
    
    // 5. Determine transition eligibility
    const transitionDecision = this.determineTransition(overallScore, task);
    
    // 6. Generate comprehensive report
    return this.generateAnalysisReport(task, criteria, overallScore, transitionDecision, context);
  }

  private async analyzeCriteria(
    taskInfo: TaskInfo, 
    context: ContextAnalysisResult
  ): Promise<TaskQualityAnalysis['criteria']> {
    // Use agents-workflow to run parallel analysis
    const workflow = await loadAgentWorkflowsFromMarkdown(taskAnalysisWorkflow);
    
    const analysisResults = await Promise.all([
      this.analyzeCoherence(taskInfo, context),
      this.analyzeFeasibility(taskInfo, context),
      this.analyzeRelevance(taskInfo, context),
      this.analyzeValueAdded(taskInfo, context),
      this.analyzeUrgency(taskInfo, context)
    ]);
    
    return {
      coherence: analysisResults[0],
      feasibility: analysisResults[1],
      relevance: analysisResults[2],
      valueAdded: analysisResults[3],
      urgency: analysisResults[4]
    };
  }
}
```

### 4. Transition Rules Integration

```typescript
// Add to TransitionRulesEngine.validateTransition()
if (fromNormalized === 'incoming' && toNormalized === 'accepted') {
  const qualityResult = await this.analyzeTaskQuality(task, board);
  
  if (!qualityResult.canTransition) {
    if (qualityResult.transitionType === 'hard-block') {
      violations.push(
        `Task quality insufficient for acceptance (score: ${qualityResult.overallScore}/10). ` +
        `Required improvements: ${qualityResult.recommendations.join(', ')}`
      );
    } else if (qualityResult.transitionType === 'soft-block') {
      const retryCount = this.getRetryCount(task.uuid);
      if (retryCount === 0) {
        violations.push(
          `Task quality needs improvement (score: ${qualityResult.overallScore}/10). ` +
          `Retry allowed after addressing: ${qualityResult.recommendations.join(', ')}`
        );
        this.incrementRetryCount(task.uuid);
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Append analysis report to task
  await this.appendAnalysisReport(task, qualityResult);
}
```

### 5. Task Enhancement System
