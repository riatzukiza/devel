# Test Integration Task

This task is used to test the comprehensive testing→review transition rule implementation.

## Testing Information

coverage-report: /home/err/devel/promethean/test-coverage-reports/high-coverage.lcov
executed-tests: test-coverage-analysis,test-quality-scoring,test-requirement-mapping
requirement-mappings: [{"requirementId": "REQ-001", "testIds": ["test-coverage-analysis"]}, {"requirementId": "REQ-002", "testIds": ["test-quality-scoring", "test-requirement-mapping"]}]

## Implementation Details

The testing transition rule should:

1. Validate coverage meets 90% threshold
2. Calculate quality scores with 75% threshold
3. Map requirements to tests
4. Generate AI analysis
5. Create comprehensive report

## Expected Outcome

Task should successfully transition from testing to review when all criteria are met.
