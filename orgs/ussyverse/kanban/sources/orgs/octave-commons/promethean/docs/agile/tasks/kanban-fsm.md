title: 2025.09.19.22.32.47
filename: Kanban FSM

A cleaned-up Kanban state machine diagram with explicit transitions for
incoming items, acceptance, rejection, and ice-boxing. Includes blocked states
and unblock paths for workflow management.
tags:

- kanban
- state machine
- workflow
- transitions
- blocked
- ice box
- incoming
- accepted
- rejected

## references: []

got it—here’s the cleaned-up **Kanban FSM** mermaid, with your tweaks:

- “New” → **Incoming**
- Incoming can go to **Accepted**, **Rejected**, or **Ice Box**
- **Blocked** reachable from **any** state (explicit edges shown), and returns to **Breakdown**
- Ice-boxing may occur in **Brainstorm** or **Planning** (not Execution)
- Kept `InReview → Done` and `Done → Ice Box`

if this matches your intent, next micro-step: I’ll list each column’s **allowed outbound transitions** (one concise line per state) so we have a human-readable rules table to pair with the diagram.
