## Description

The `packages/boardrev/src/04-enhanced-context.ts` file contains large functions with repetitive patterns and syntax errors that need immediate attention. The file has compilation errors and overly complex logic that impacts maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fix all TypeScript compilation errors in `04-enhanced-context.ts`
- [ ] Break down large functions into smaller, focused functions
- [ ] Eliminate repetitive patterns through helper functions or abstractions
- [ ] Ensure all functions pass ESLint complexity and maintainability rules
- [ ] Add proper error handling and type safety
- [ ] Maintain existing functionality and ensure all tests pass

## Technical Details

**Target File:** `packages/boardrev/src/04-enhanced-context.ts`
**Current Issues:**

- Multiple TypeScript compilation errors (lines 379-395)
- Unterminated string literals and syntax errors
- Missing imports (`readMaybe`, `TaskFM`, `Priority`)
- Large functions with repetitive patterns
- Type mismatches in interface extensions

**Specific Errors to Fix:**

- Line 379: Cannot find name 'readMaybe'
- Line 380-384: Cannot find name 'TaskFM'
- Line 391: Unterminated string literal
- Line 392: Cannot find name 'hits'
- Line 394: Cannot find name 'Priority'

**Refactoring Approach:**

1. Fix immediate compilation errors and missing imports
2. Identify and extract repetitive patterns into reusable functions
3. Break down large functions into logical components
4. Add proper TypeScript types and error handling
5. Ensure all extracted functions are well-tested

## Dependencies

- May depend on fixes in `05-evaluate.ts` due to shared interfaces

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:** File has compilation errors blocking the build
**Mitigation:** Fix compilation errors first, then proceed with refactoring in small increments
