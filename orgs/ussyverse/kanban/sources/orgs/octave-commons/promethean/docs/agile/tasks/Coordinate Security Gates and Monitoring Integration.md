### Technical Integration Details

#### Shared Validation Engine
```javascript
// Unified validation engine for all components
class UnifiedValidationEngine {
  constructor() {
    this.rules = new Map();
    this.ruleEngine = new RuleEngine();
    this.complianceScorer = new ComplianceScorer();
  }
  
  async validate(task, context = {}) {
    const results = {
      compliant: true,
      violations: [],
      score: 100,
      details: {}
    };
    
    // Apply all relevant rules
    for (const [ruleName, rule] of this.rules) {
      if (rule.isApplicable(task, context)) {
        const ruleResult = await this.ruleEngine.apply(rule, task, context);
        results.violations.push(...ruleResult.violations);
        results.details[ruleName] = ruleResult;
      }
    }
    
    // Calculate overall compliance
    results.compliant = results.violations.length === 0;
    results.score = this.complianceScorer.calculate(results.violations);
    
    return results;
  }
  
  registerRule(rule) {
    this.rules.set(rule.name, rule);
  }
}
```

#### Integrated Alert System
```javascript
// Coordinated alert system for all components
class IntegratedAlertSystem {
  constructor() {
    this.channels = new Map();
    this.alertQueue = [];
    this.aggregationRules = new Map();
    this.rateLimiters = new Map();
  }
  
  async sendAlert(source, alert) {
    // Enrich alert with source information
    const enrichedAlert = {
      ...alert,
      source: source,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      id: this.generateAlertId()
    };
    
    // Check for aggregation opportunities
    const aggregatedAlert = this.aggregateAlert(enrichedAlert);
    if (aggregatedAlert) {
      await this.processAggregatedAlert(aggregatedAlert);
      return;
    }
    
    // Apply rate limiting
    if (!this.checkRateLimit(enrichedAlert)) {
      return;
    }
    
    // Send to appropriate channels
    await this.routeAlert(enrichedAlert);
  }
  
  aggregateAlert(alert) {
    for (const [ruleKey, rule] of this.aggregationRules) {
      if (rule.matches(alert)) {
        return rule.aggregate(alert);
      }
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

#### Coordinated Enforcement Workflow
```javascript
// Coordinated enforcement between gates and monitoring
class CoordinatedEnforcementWorkflow {
  constructor() {
    this.validationEngine = new UnifiedValidationEngine();
    this.alertSystem = new IntegratedAlertSystem();
    this.securityGates = new SecurityGates();
    this.monitoringSystem = new MonitoringSystem();
  }
  
  async handleTaskChange(taskId, change) {
    const task = await this.getTask(taskId);
    
    // Monitor the change
    const monitoringResult = await this.monitoringSystem.processChange(task, change);
    
    // Check if this is a status transition that requires gate enforcement
    if (change.type === 'status_change') {
      const gateResult = await this.securityGates.validateTransition(
        task, 
        change.fromStatus, 
        change.toStatus
      );
      
      // Combine monitoring and gate results
      const combinedResult = this.combineResults(monitoringResult, gateResult);
      
      // Handle violations
      if (!combinedResult.compliant) {
        await this.handleViolations(task, combinedResult.violations);
      }
      
      return combinedResult;
    }
    
    return monitoringResult;
  }
  
  combineResults(monitoringResult, gateResult) {
    return {
      compliant: monitoringResult.compliant && gateResult.compliant,
      violations: [...monitoringResult.violations, ...gateResult.violations],
      score: Math.min(monitoringResult.score, gateResult.score),
      enforcement: gateResult.enforcement || null,
      monitoring: monitoringResult
    };
  }
}
