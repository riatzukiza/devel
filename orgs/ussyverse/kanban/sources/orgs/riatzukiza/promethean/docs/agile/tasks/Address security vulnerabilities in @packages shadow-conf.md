CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention\n\n**Issues Identified:**\n- Path traversal risks in file handling\n- Unsafe input validation in ecosystem generation\n- Potential code injection in template processing\n- Missing input sanitization in CLI arguments\n- Insecure file path operations\n\n**Impact:**\n- Critical security vulnerability\n- Potential system compromise\n- Data exposure risks\n- Code execution possibilities\n\n**Files Affected:**\n- src/ecosystem.ts (path handling)\n- src/bin/shadow-conf.ts (CLI input)\n- File processing utilities\n\n**Story Points: 5**\n\n**Required Actions:**\n1. Implement comprehensive input validation\n2. Add path traversal protection\n3. Sanitize all user inputs\n4. Secure file operations\n5. Add security tests\n6. Review all file system access\n7. Implement safe defaults\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- All inputs validated and sanitized\n- Path traversal attacks prevented\n- File operations secured\n- Security tests pass\n- No code injection vectors
