## 🎯 Task Overview\n\nResolve all 18 ESLint errors to ensure code quality and consistency in the @promethean-os/simtasks package.\n\n## 📋 Description\n\nThis task addresses the ESLint errors identified in the code review. There are 18 ESLint errors throughout the codebase that need to be resolved to ensure code quality and consistency with project standards.\n\n## 🔍 Scope\n\n**Files to be updated:**\n- All TypeScript files in the package\n- Focus on core processing modules and supporting files\n- Ensure compliance with project's ESLint configuration\n\n## 📝 Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All 18 ESLint errors resolved\n- [ ] Code follows project's ESLint configuration\n- [ ] No new ESLint warnings introduced\n- [ ] ESLint auto-fix applied where appropriate\n- [ ] Manual fixes for complex rule violations\n- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass\n\n## 🎯 Story Points: 8\n\n**Breakdown:**\n- Run ESLint audit and categorize errors: 1 point\n- Fix auto-correctable ESLint errors: 2 points\n- Manually fix complex ESLint errors: 5 points\n\n## 🚧 Implementation Strategy\n\n### Audit Phase\n- Run comprehensive ESLint audit\n- Identify and categorize all 18 errors by type and severity\n- Determine which errors can be auto-fixed vs manual\n\n### Auto-Fix Phase\n- Apply ESLint auto-fix for simple rule violations\n- Focus on formatting, unused imports, basic style issues\n- Validate that auto-fixes don't break functionality\n\n### Manual Fix Phase\n- Address complex errors requiring manual intervention\n- Focus on logic issues, complex refactoring requirements\n- Ensure fixes maintain code functionality\n\n### Validation Phase\n- Run full ESLint suite to confirm all errors resolved\n- Ensure no new warnings introduced\n- Validate that all tests still pass\n\n## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations\n\n- **Risk:** Breaking existing functionality\n- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing and gradual fixes\n- **Risk:** Complex refactoring requirements\n- **Mitigation:** Prioritize simple fixes first, tackle complex ones systematically\n- **Risk:** Style inconsistencies\n- **Mitigation:** Follow project's ESLint configuration strictly\n\n## 📚 Dependencies\n\n- Should be completed after type safety improvements\n- Can be done in parallel with function complexity reduction\n- Prerequisite for comprehensive testing\n\n## 🧪 Testing Requirements\n\n- All existing tests must continue to pass\n- ESLint should run clean with no errors or warnings\n- Integration tests to verify functionality preserved\n- Code quality metrics should improve\n\n## 🔧 Common ESLint Issues to Address\n\nBased on typical TypeScript codebases, likely issues include:\n- Unused variables/imports\n- Missing semicolons or formatting issues\n- Complex logic that needs refactoring\n- Type-related issues that complement other tasks\n- Code style and consistency problems
