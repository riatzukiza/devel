## 📡 Critical: Agent OS Core Message Protocol

### Problem Summary

Agent OS needs a fundamental message protocol to enable structured natural language communication between agents and components.

### Technical Details

- **Component**: Agent OS Core
- **Feature Type**: Foundational Protocol
- **Impact**: Critical for all agent communication
- **Priority**: P0 (Foundation for Agent OS)

### Scope

- Design message format and structure for agent communication
- Define message types (commands, queries, responses, events)
- Create message metadata and context handling
- Design message routing and addressing scheme

### Breakdown Tasks (detailed plan)

#### Phase 1: Protocol Design (3 hours)

- [ ] 1.1 Design canonical JSON message envelope (headers, body, metadata)
- [ ] 1.2 Define core message types and required fields (command, query, response, event)
- [ ] 1.3 Specify routing/addressing model (direct, broadcast, topic, service discovery fields)
- [ ] 1.4 Define correlation and causation fields (correlation_id, causation_id, reply_to)

#### Phase 2: Specification (3 hours)

- [ ] 2.1 Produce formal protocol specification document (purpose, state model, flows)
- [ ] 2.2 Author JSON Schemas (or Zod equivalents) for each message type
- [ ] 2.3 Define error schema and status reporting model (error codes, retry metadata)
- [ ] 2.4 Specify extensibility hooks (custom headers, versioning, feature flags)

#### Phase 3: Validation & Security (2 hours)

- [ ] 3.1 Implement schema validation examples and small test harness (samples for each type)
- [ ] 3.2 Run scenario-based tests (sync request/response, async eventing, failure cases)
- [ ] 3.3 Perform security review and threat mitigations (injection, replay, auth expectations)

#### Phase 4: Documentation & Handoff (2 hours)

- [ ] 4.1 Create implementation guide with code snippets (producer and consumer)
- [ ] 4.2 Create message examples and sequence diagrams for common flows
- [ ] 4.3 Add checklist for implementers (validation, telemetry, monitoring)
- [ ] 4.4 Prepare artifacts for CI (schemas, test cases) and location recommendation (docs/inbox or packages/schema)

**Planned subtasks (8 primary items):**

- Draft canonical envelope + metadata schema (1.1 + 2.2)
- Routing/addressing model (1.3)
- Correlation/causation pattern (1.4)
- Formal spec document (2.1)
- Error schema & retry model (2.3)
- Schema validation harness + tests (3.1 + 3.2)
- Security review and mitigations (3.3)
- Implementation guide + examples + CI artifacts (4.1 + 4.4)

(These will be added to the kanban as todos; if todowrite is available we will use it, otherwise the checklist above acts as the authoritative todo list.)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Message schema supports all required communication patterns
- [ ] Message types cover commands, queries, responses, and events
- [ ] Context propagation works across message boundaries
- [ ] Routing scheme supports both direct and broadcast messaging
- [ ] Protocol is extensible for future message types

### Technical Requirements

- JSON-based message format with schema validation
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous messaging
- Message correlation for request-response patterns
- Proper error handling and status reporting

### Definition of Done

- Core message protocol is fully specified
- JSON schemas defined and validated
- Complete documentation with examples
- Protocol ready for implementation
- Security considerations addressed
- Extensibility framework in place\n\n**Scope:**\n- Design message format and structure for agent communication\n- Define message types (commands, queries, responses, events)\n- Create message metadata and context handling\n- Design message routing and addressing scheme\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] Message schema supports all required communication patterns\n- [ ] Message types cover commands, queries, responses, and events\n- [ ] Context propagation works across message boundaries\n- [ ] Routing scheme supports both direct and broadcast messaging\n- [ ] Protocol is extensible for future message types\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n- JSON-based message format with schema validation\n- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous messaging\n- Message correlation for request-response patterns\n- Proper error handling and status reporting\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- None (foundational component)\n\n**Labels:** agent-os,protocol,messaging,core,design,critical
