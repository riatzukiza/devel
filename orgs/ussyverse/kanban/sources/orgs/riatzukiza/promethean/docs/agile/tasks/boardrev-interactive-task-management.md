# Add interactive task management and auto-updates to boardrev

## Description
Current boardrev is read-only analysis. Need interactive capabilities to automatically update task status, suggest improvements, and manage task lifecycle.

## Proposed Solution
- Auto-update task status based on confidence thresholds
- Suggest task splits and merges for better scope management
- Identify duplicate and overlapping tasks
- Recommend assignees based on code ownership analysis
- Interactive review and approval workflow

## Benefits
- Reduced manual task management overhead
- More accurate and up-to-date task status
- Better task organization and scoping
- Improved team collaboration and assignments
- Streamlined review and approval processes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic status updates with confidence thresholds
- [ ] Task relationship analysis (duplicates, dependencies)
- [ ] Code ownership-based assignee recommendations
- [ ] Task split/merge suggestions with reasoning
- [ ] Interactive review workflow with approval steps
- [ ] Audit trail for all automated changes

## Technical Details
- **Files to create**: `src/10-task-manager.ts`, `src/11-analyzer.ts`, `src/12-workflow.ts`
- **New types**: `TaskRelationship`, `OwnershipAnalysis`, `UpdateRecommendation`
- **Integration**: Git history analysis, file ownership tracking, dependency graph
- **Safety**: Dry-run mode, change previews, approval workflows

## Notes
Should include safety mechanisms to prevent unwanted automatic changes. All updates should be previewable and require explicit approval or high confidence thresholds.

```clojure
(for [status (kanban :get-columns)]
  (for [task (kanban :get-column status)]
    (codex :exec (+
        status.prompt ;; ## Review the task requirements for completion, marking them off as you go. if one is missing, stop and update the task, and bounce this card back via a valid transition
        task.body))))
```
