## Problem

The Kanban UI server was serving JavaScript modules with `application/javascript` content type, which was causing MIME type errors in browsers and preventing the virtual scroll component from loading properly.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated MIME types** in `packages/kanban/src/lib/ui-server.ts`:

   - Changed all JavaScript assets from `application/javascript` to `text/javascript`
   - Enhanced CORS headers for ES modules:
     - Added `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: unsafe-none`
     - Added `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin`
     - Updated `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` to include `OPTIONS`

2. **Fixed build error** in `packages/kanban/src/lib/kanban.ts`:
   - Removed duplicate `export` keyword on line 1152

## Testing

- Built the kanban package successfully
- Started UI server on port 4173 and confirmed it serves assets with correct MIME types
- Virtual scroll component now loads without MIME type errors

## Files Modified

- `packages/kanban/src/lib/ui-server.ts` - MIME type and CORS header fixes
- `packages/kanban/src/lib/kanban.ts` - Build error fix
