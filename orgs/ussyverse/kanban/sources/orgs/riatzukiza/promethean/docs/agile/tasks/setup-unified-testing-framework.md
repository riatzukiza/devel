## 🧪 Set Up Unified Testing Framework

### 📋 Description

Establish a comprehensive testing framework that supports TypeScript, ClojureScript, and Electron components within the unified package. The framework must provide consistent testing patterns, coverage reporting, and integration with the existing CI/CD pipeline.

### 🎯 Goals

- Unified test configuration for all languages
- Consistent testing patterns and utilities
- Comprehensive coverage reporting
- Integration testing capabilities
- CI/CD pipeline integration

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test configuration for TypeScript (AVA)
- [ ] Test configuration for ClojureScript (cljs.test)
- [ ] Electron application testing setup
- [ ] Coverage reporting across all languages
- [ ] Integration test framework
- [ ] Test scripts in package.json
- [ ] CI/CD integration with test execution

### 🔧 Technical Specifications

#### Testing Stack:

1. **TypeScript Testing**

   - AVA test runner with TypeScript support
   - Test utilities and helpers
   - Mock and stub capabilities
   - Coverage reporting with c8

2. **ClojureScript Testing**

   - cljs.test integration
   - Browser-based testing with Karma
   - Node.js testing support
   - Coverage reporting with shadow-cljs

3. **Electron Testing**

   - Spectron for Electron app testing
   - Main and renderer process testing
   - Integration testing capabilities
   - Cross-platform testing

4. **Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end test scenarios
   - API testing with supertest
   - Database testing with test containers
   - Performance testing hooks

#### Test Configuration:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "pnpm test:ts && pnpm test:cljs",
    "test:ts": "ava",
    "test:cljs": "shadow-cljs compile test && node out/test.js",
    "test:electron": "ava --config ava.electron.config.mjs",
    "test:integration": "ava --config ava.integration.config.mjs",
    "coverage": "c8 ava && c8 report --reporter=html",
    "test:watch": "ava --watch"
  }
}
```

### 📁 Files/Components to Create

#### Test Configuration:

1. **`packages/opencode-unified/ava.config.mjs`**

   - Main AVA configuration for TypeScript tests
   - Test file patterns and exclusions
   - Coverage settings and reporters

2. **`packages/opencode-unified/ava.electron.config.mjs`**

   - Electron-specific test configuration
   - Main and renderer process test setup

3. **`packages/opencode-unified/ava.integration.config.mjs`**

   - Integration test configuration
   - Database and external service setup

4. **`packages/opencode-unified/test-setup.ts`**

   - Common test utilities and helpers
   - Mock configurations
   - Test database setup

5. **`packages/opencode-unified/shadow-cljs.edn`** (test section)
   - ClojureScript test build configuration
   - Test runner setup

#### Test Structure:

```

│   └── renderer/          # Renderer process tests
└── integration/           # Cross-language integration tests
```

### 🧪 Testing Requirements
