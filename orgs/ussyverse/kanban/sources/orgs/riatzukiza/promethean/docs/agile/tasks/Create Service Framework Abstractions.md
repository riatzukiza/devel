## Problem\n\nCode duplication analysis revealed repeated service framework patterns across packages:\n- Common service lifecycle management duplicated\n- Repeated service initialization and shutdown patterns\n- Duplicate service discovery and registration logic\n- Inconsistent service communication patterns\n\n## Solution\n\nCreate service framework abstractions that provide standardized service lifecycle, discovery, and communication patterns across the Promethean Framework.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Phase 1: Service Pattern Analysis\n- Audit existing service implementations for common patterns\n- Identify service lifecycle management approaches\n- Map service discovery and registration needs\n- Document service communication patterns\n\n### Phase 2: Service Framework Core\nCreate comprehensive service framework with:\n- Service lifecycle management\n- Service discovery and registration\n- Inter-service communication patterns\n- Service health monitoring\n- Service dependency management\n- Graceful shutdown handling\n\n### Phase 3: Key Components\n- Service base class with lifecycle hooks\n- Service registry and discovery\n- Communication abstractions (HTTP, events, messaging)\n- Health monitoring integration\n- Dependency injection container\n- Service configuration integration\n\n### Phase 4: Integration Points\n- Integration with existing web-utils enhancements\n- Configuration management integration\n- Health check system integration\n- Metrics and monitoring integration\n\n## Expected Impact\n\n- **Consistency**: Standardized service patterns across all services\n- **Reliability**: Better service lifecycle management\n- **Developer Experience**: Simplified service creation\n- **Maintenance**: Reduced service boilerplate code\n- **Scalability**: Standardized service communication patterns\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- All new services use framework abstractions\n- 400+ lines of duplicate service code eliminated\n- Service setup time reduced by 80%\n- Consistent service lifecycle management\n- Improved service reliability and monitoring
