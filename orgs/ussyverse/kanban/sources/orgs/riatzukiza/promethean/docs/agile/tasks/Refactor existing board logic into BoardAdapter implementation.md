## 🔄 Critical: Refactor Board Logic into BoardAdapter

### Problem Summary

Current kanban board logic is tightly coupled in kanban.ts and needs to be extracted into a dedicated BoardAdapter class following the new adapter architecture.

### Technical Details

- **Component**: Kanban Adapter System
- **Feature Type**: Refactoring
- **Impact**: Critical for adapter architecture completion
- **Priority**: P0 (Required for clean architecture)

### Requirements

1. Create BoardAdapter class extending BaseAdapter
2. Move existing board read/write logic from kanban.ts to board-adapter.ts
3. Implement all required KanbanAdapter interface methods:

   - readTasks(): Parse markdown board file and extract tasks
   - writeTasks(): Generate markdown board from task array
   - detectChanges(): Compare board state with other adapter tasks
   - applyChanges(): Apply sync changes to board file
   - validateLocation(): Check if board file exists and is readable
   - initialize(): Create board file if it doesn't exist

4. Handle board-specific formatting and frontmatter
5. Maintain backward compatibility with existing board format
6. Add proper error handling for file operations

### Breakdown Tasks

#### Phase 1: Analysis (1 hour)

- [ ] Analyze existing board logic in kanban.ts
- [ ] Identify all board-related functions
- [ ] Plan extraction strategy
- [ ] Identify dependencies and coupling points

#### Phase 2: Refactoring (3 hours)

- [ ] Create BoardAdapter class structure
- [ ] Move board reading logic
- [ ] Move board writing logic
- [ ] Implement remaining adapter methods
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

#### Phase 3: Testing (2 hours)

- [ ] Create unit tests for BoardAdapter
- [ ] Test board parsing and generation
- [ ] Test with existing board files
- [ ] Validate backward compatibility

#### Phase 4: Integration (1 hour)

- [ ] Update kanban.ts to use BoardAdapter
- [ ] Test integration with CLI
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Performance validation

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] BoardAdapter implemented in packages/kanban/src/adapters/board-adapter.ts
- [ ] All existing board logic successfully moved from kanban.ts
- [ ] BoardAdapter implements KanbanAdapter interface completely
- [ ] Existing board files continue to work without changes
- [ ] Unit tests for board parsing and generation
- [ ] Integration tests with existing board files

### Dependencies

- Task 1: Abstract KanbanAdapter interface and base class

### Definition of Done

- Board logic completely extracted to BoardAdapter
- All adapter methods implemented correctly
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Integration with kanban system complete
- Documentation updated\n\n### Description\nExtract the current markdown board file handling logic into a dedicated BoardAdapter class that implements the KanbanAdapter interface.\n\n### Requirements\n1.
