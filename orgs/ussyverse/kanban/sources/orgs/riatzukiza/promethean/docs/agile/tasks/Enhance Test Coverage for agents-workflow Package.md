# Enhance Test Coverage for agents-workflow Package\n\n## 🧪 Current Test Coverage Analysis\n\n**Current Status**: Limited test coverage with critical gaps in error handling, edge cases, and integration scenarios\n\n### Critical Coverage Gaps:\n\n**Missing Unit Tests:**\n- src/workflow/loader.ts - No tests for file loading, definition resolution\n- src/workflow/mermaid.ts - No tests for Mermaid diagram generation  \n- src/workflow/types.ts - No validation tests for type schemas\n- src/runtime.ts - No tests for workflow execution\n- Error handling paths - No tests for failure scenarios\n- Security features - No tests for path traversal protection\n\n**Missing Integration Tests:**\n- End-to-end workflow execution\n- Provider integration with real services\n- File system operations with various scenarios\n- Error propagation across module boundaries\n\n## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Coverage Requirements:\n- [ ] Overall coverage: ≥90% line coverage for all modules\n- [ ] Branch coverage: ≥85% for all conditional logic\n- [ ] Function coverage: 100% for all exported functions\n- [ ] Error path coverage: 100% for all error handling paths\n\n### Test Categories:\n- [ ] Unit tests: All individual functions and classes\n- [ ] Integration tests: Cross-module interactions\n- [ ] Error scenario tests: All failure modes\n- [ ] Security tests: Path traversal and input validation\n- [ ] Performance tests: Load and stress testing\n\n## 🔧 Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Core Module Testing (2 days)\n- loader.ts comprehensive tests including security scenarios\n- Provider tests with error handling\n- Type validation tests\n- Runtime execution tests\n\n### Phase 2: Error Handling Tests (1 day)\n- Security feature tests (path traversal, input validation)\n- Error scenario tests (timeouts, network failures)\n- Error propagation and classification tests\n\n### Phase 3: Integration Tests (1.5 days)\n- End-to-end workflow execution tests\n- Provider integration tests\n- Concurrent workflow tests\n- Performance and load tests\n\n### Phase 4: Test Infrastructure (0.5 day)\n- Test utilities and helpers\n- Mock implementations\n- Test fixtures and data\n- Coverage reporting setup\n\n## 📊 Success Metrics\n\n### Coverage Targets:\n- [ ] Line coverage: ≥90%\n- [ ] Branch coverage: ≥85%\n- [ ] Function coverage: 100%\n- [ ] Error path coverage: 100%\n\n### Module-Specific Targets:\n\n\n## ⛓️ Dependencies\n- **Blocked by**: Fix Critical Linting Violations\n- **Blocked by**: Add Error Handling and Security Fixes\n- **Blocks**: Production deployment readiness\n\n---\n\n*Comprehensive test coverage is essential for production readiness and will prevent regressions during future development.*
