## Context

Implement comprehensive event-driven plugin system with before/after hooks for tool execution, enabling interception and enhancement of all tool operations.

## Key Requirements

- tool.execute.before and tool.execute.after hooks
- Hook registration system with priority ordering
- Context passing with tool metadata
- Error handling and rollback for failed hooks
- Performance monitoring and timeout protection
- Comprehensive test suite for hook system
- Document hook API with examples

## Files to Create/Modify

- `packages/opencode-client/src/plugins/event-hooks.ts` (new)
- `packages/opencode-client/src/hooks/tool-execute-hooks.ts` (new)
- `packages/opencode-client/src/types/plugin-hooks.ts` (new)
- `packages/opencode-client/src/plugins/index.ts` (modify)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hook system can intercept any tool execution
- [ ] Hooks can modify input/output data safely
- [ ] Priority-based hook execution works correctly
- [ ] Error handling prevents system failures
- [ ] Performance monitoring tracks hook execution time
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage achieved
- [ ] Documentation with examples provided

## Dependencies

None

## Notes

This is the foundation for the entire plugin architecture and must be implemented first.
