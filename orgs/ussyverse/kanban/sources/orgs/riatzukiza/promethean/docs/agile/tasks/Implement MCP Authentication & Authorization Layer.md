## 🔐 Critical Security: MCP Authentication & Authorization Layer

### Problem Summary
MCP-kanban integration lacks secure authentication and authorization, creating critical security vulnerabilities where unauthorized users can access and modify kanban data.

### Technical Details
- **Component**: MCP-kanban Bridge API
- **Vulnerability Type**: Missing Authentication/Authorization
- **Impact**: Unauthorized data access and modification
- **Risk Level**: Critical (P0)

### Scope
- Implement JWT-based authentication for MCP endpoints
- Create role-based access control (RBAC) for different operation types
- Add API key management for external integrations
- Implement session management and timeout handling

### Breakdown Tasks

#### Phase 1: Security Design (3 hours)
- [ ] Design authentication architecture
- [ ] Define role-based permission matrix
- [ ] Plan API key management system
- [ ] Design session management strategy
- [ ] Create security requirements specification

#### Phase 2: Authentication Implementation (6 hours)
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation/validation
- [ ] Create authentication middleware
- [ ] Implement role-based access controls
- [ ] Add API key management endpoints
- [ ] Create session management system
- [ ] Add authentication to all MCP endpoints

#### Phase 3: Security Testing (3 hours)
- [ ] Create authentication test suite
- [ ] Test role-based permissions
- [ ] Verify API key security
- [ ] Test session timeout behavior
- [ ] Perform security penetration testing

#### Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring (2 hours)
- [ ] Deploy with feature flags
- [ ] Configure production security policies
- [ ] Add security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Conduct security review

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MCP endpoints require valid authentication tokens
- [ ] Role-based permissions prevent unauthorized destructive operations
- [ ] API keys can be generated, rotated, and revoked
- [ ] Sessions timeout appropriately and require re-authentication
- [ ] All auth failures are properly logged and monitored

### Security Requirements
- Use industry-standard JWT implementation
- Implement proper token validation and refresh
- Secure storage of API keys and secrets
- Audit logging for all authentication events

### Definition of Done
- All MCP endpoints are properly secured
- Role-based access control is fully functional
- Comprehensive security test coverage
- Security monitoring and alerting in place
- Documentation updated with security guidelines
- Security team approval obtained\n\n**Scope:**\n- Implement JWT-based authentication for MCP endpoints\n- Create role-based access control (RBAC) for different operation types\n- Add API key management for external integrations\n- Implement session management and timeout handling\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] MCP endpoints require valid authentication tokens\n- [ ] Role-based permissions prevent unauthorized destructive operations\n- [ ] API keys can be generated, rotated, and revoked\n- [ ] Sessions timeout appropriately and require re-authentication\n- [ ] All auth failures are properly logged and monitored\n\n**Security Requirements:**\n- Use industry-standard JWT implementation\n- Implement proper token validation and refresh\n- Secure storage of API keys and secrets\n- Audit logging for all authentication events\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- None (can be implemented independently)\n\n**Labels:** mcp,kanban,security,authentication,authorization,critical
