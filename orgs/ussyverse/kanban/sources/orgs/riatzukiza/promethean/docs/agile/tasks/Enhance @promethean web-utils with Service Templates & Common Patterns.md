## Problem\n\nCode duplication analysis identified opportunities to enhance  with service templates and common patterns that are currently duplicated across packages:\n\n- Service initialization patterns repeated in multiple packages\n- Common middleware setups duplicated\n- Error handling patterns reimplemented\n- Configuration loading patterns scattered across services\n\n## Current State\n\n-  has basic utilities but lacks service templates\n- Each service reimplements common Fastify setup patterns\n- No standardized service bootstrapping process\n- Missing common service abstractions and patterns\n\n## Solution\n\nEnhance  with comprehensive service templates, middleware, and bootstrapping utilities to eliminate duplication and standardize service development.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Phase 1: Service Pattern Analysis\n- [ ] Analyze existing service implementations for common patterns\n- [ ] Identify repeated middleware configurations\n- [ ] Map common service initialization flows\n- [ ] Document service configuration patterns\n\n### Phase 2: Service Template Framework\nCreate comprehensive service template system:\n\n#### Service Builder Pattern\n\n\n#### Service Templates\n\n\n### Phase 3: Common Middleware Collection\nCreate standardized middleware implementations:\n\n#### Authentication & Authorization\n\n\n#### Error Handling\n\n\n#### Request/Response Logging\n\n\n### Phase 4: Configuration Management\nCreate standardized configuration loading:\n\n#### Service Configuration\n\n\n### Phase 5: Service Bootstrap Utilities\nCreate service startup and lifecycle management:\n\n#### Service Lifecycle\n\n\n#### Graceful Shutdown\nReceived , starting graceful shutdown...\n\n## Files to Add to @promethean-os/web-utils\n\n\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Simple API Service\n\n\n### MCP Service\n\n\n## Migration Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Additive Changes\n- [ ] Add new utilities alongside existing ones\n- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility\n- [ ] Create migration guide\n\n### Phase 2: Gradual Adoption\n- [ ] Update one service at a time\n- [ ] Provide examples and documentation\n- [ ] Gather feedback and iterate\n\n### Phase 3: Deprecation\n- [ ] Deprecate old patterns\n- [ ] Update service templates\n- [ ] Remove deprecated code\n\n## Expected Impact\n\n- **Development Speed**: 70% reduction in service setup time\n- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across all services\n- **Quality**: Built-in best practices and security\n- **Maintenance**: Centralized service logic\n- **Developer Experience**: Simplified service creation\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- [ ] All new services use enhanced web-utils\n- [ ] 100+ lines of duplicate service code eliminated\n- [ ] Service setup time reduced from hours to minutes\n- [ ] Consistent middleware and configuration patterns\n- [ ] Improved security and reliability across services\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Requires coordination with service maintainers\n- Need to update service documentation\n- Should integrate with existing configuration systems\n- Must maintain backward compatibility during transition
