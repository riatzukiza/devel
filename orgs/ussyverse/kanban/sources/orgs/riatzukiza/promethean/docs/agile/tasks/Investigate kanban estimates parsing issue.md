## Technical Investigation: Estimates Parsing\n\n### Problem\nTasks with proper estimates in frontmatter are not being read by the kanban system, preventing breakdown → ready transitions.\n\n### Investigation Steps\n1. Audit frontmatter format vs working tasks\n2. Test estimates parsing with different formats\n3. Check kanban package estimate reading logic\n4. Verify YAML parsing in task files\n5. Test transition rules with debug output\n\n### Expected Outcome\n- Identify root cause of estimates not being read\n- Fix parsing issue or update format requirements\n- Enable breakdown tasks to move to ready column\n- Clear breakdown bottleneck
