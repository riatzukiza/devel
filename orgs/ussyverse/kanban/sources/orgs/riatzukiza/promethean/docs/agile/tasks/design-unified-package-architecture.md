## 🏗️ Design Unified Package Architecture

### 📋 Description

Design the comprehensive architecture for consolidating `@promethean-os/opencode-client`, `opencode-cljs-electron`, and `@promethean-os/dualstore-http` into a unified `@promethean-os/opencode-unified` package. This architecture must support TypeScript, ClojureScript, and Electron components while maintaining clean separation of concerns and enabling seamless integration.

### 🎯 Goals

- Create a unified component model that supports all three existing systems
- Define clear integration patterns between TypeScript, ClojureScript, and Electron
- Establish migration strategy that minimizes disruption
- Design scalable architecture for future enhancements

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Architecture document showing component relationships and data flow
- [x] Decision matrix for technology choices with rationale
- [x] Migration strategy document with phase-by-phase approach
- [x] Risk assessment and mitigation plan for each architectural decision
- [x] Component dependency diagram with clear boundaries
- [x] Interface definitions for cross-language communication

### 🔧 Technical Specifications

#### Core Components to Design:

1. **Unified Service Layer**

   - HTTP server infrastructure (from dualstore-http)
   - Authentication and authorization middleware
   - API routing and endpoint management
   - Server-sent events (SSE) streaming

2. **Client Library Layer**

   - Agent management APIs (from opencode-client)
   - Session and messaging systems
   - Ollama queue functionality
   - CLI and tool interfaces

3. **Editor Integration Layer**
   - ClojureScript editor components (from opencode-cljs-electron)
   - Electron main process integration
   - Web UI components
   - Keybinding and UI systems

#### Cross-Cutting Concerns:

- **State Management**: Unified approach for TypeScript and ClojureScript state
- **Event System**: Common event bus for all components
- **Configuration**: Unified configuration management
- **Logging**: Consistent logging across all languages
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling patterns

### 📁 Files/Components to Create

- `docs/architecture/unified-architecture.md` - Main architecture document
- `docs/architecture/component-diagram.md` - Visual component relationships
- `docs/architecture/migration-strategy.md` - Detailed migration plan
- `docs/architecture/risk-assessment.md` - Risk analysis and mitigation
- `docs/architecture/interface-definitions.md` - Cross-language interfaces
