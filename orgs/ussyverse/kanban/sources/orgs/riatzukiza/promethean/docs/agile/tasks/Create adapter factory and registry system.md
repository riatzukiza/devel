## 🏭 Critical: Adapter Factory and Registry System

### Problem Summary

Kanban system needs a factory pattern and registry system for dynamically creating and managing different types of adapters based on configuration.

### Technical Details

- **Component**: Kanban Adapter System
- **Feature Type**: Core Infrastructure
- **Impact**: Critical for adapter management and CLI integration
- **Priority**: P0 (Required for dynamic adapter creation)

### Requirements

1. Create AdapterFactory class in packages/kanban/src/adapters/factory.ts
2. Create AdapterRegistry for registering adapter types
3. Support adapter type resolution from strings (e.g., 'board', 'directory', 'github')
4. Parse target/source specifications in format 'type:location'
5. Handle adapter instantiation with proper configuration
6. Support adapter-specific options and initialization
7. Add validation for unknown adapter types
8. Include error handling for adapter creation failures

### Breakdown Tasks

#### Phase 1: Design (1 hour)

- [ ] Design factory and registry architecture
- [ ] Plan adapter type resolution system
- [ ] Design configuration parsing logic
- [ ] Create TypeScript type definitions

#### Phase 2: Implementation (3 hours)

- [ ] Implement AdapterRegistry class
- [ ] Create AdapterFactory class
- [ ] Add type resolution logic
- [ ] Implement configuration parsing
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Create adapter instantiation logic

#### Phase 3: Testing (2 hours)

- [ ] Create unit tests for registry
- [ ] Test factory creation scenarios
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test configuration parsing

#### Phase 4: Integration (1 hour)

- [ ] Integrate with existing adapters
- [ ] Test with BoardAdapter and DirectoryAdapter
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] CLI integration testing

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AdapterFactory implemented with createAdapter(type, location) method
- [ ] AdapterRegistry with registerAdapter() and getAdapter() methods
- [ ] Proper parsing of 'type:location' format
- [ ] Error handling for invalid types and locations
- [ ] Unit tests for factory and registry operations
- [ ] Integration tests with BoardAdapter and DirectoryAdapter

### Dependencies

- Task 1: Abstract KanbanAdapter interface and base class
- Task 2: BoardAdapter implementation
- Task 3: DirectoryAdapter implementation

### Definition of Done

- Factory and registry systems are fully implemented
- All adapter types can be created dynamically
- Configuration parsing works correctly
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Integration with kanban system complete
- Documentation updated\n\n### Description\nImplement a factory pattern and registry system for creating and managing kanban adapters dynamically based on type specifications.\n\n### Requirements\n1.
