# Openclawssy

## The Ussycoded Agent Runtime

Openclawssy is high-agency AI automation for builders who want speed and control at the same time.

| Speed Lane | Control Lane | Audit Lane |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One Go binary, multi-channel runtime (CLI/API/dashboard/chat/scheduler) | Deny-by-default capability policy and workspace-safe boundaries | Reproducible run artifacts + append-only audit logs |
| Fast iteration with tool-enabled agents | Explicit config and policy-gated operations | Clear failure modes and debuggable traces |

### Launch In 3 Commands

```bash
make build
./bin/openclawssy setup
./bin/openclawssy serve --token change-me
```

If `openclawssy` is already on your PATH, you can drop the `./bin/` prefix.

### What New Users Get In The First 10 Minutes

- A running local agent service with a dashboard UI.
- A real tool-capable run (not just plain chat output).
- Inspectable artifacts at `.openclawssy/agents/<agent>/runs/<run-id>/`.
- A secure baseline: policy controls, workspace guards, and redacted secrets.

Try this once `serve` is running:

```bash
./bin/openclawssy ask "hello"
./bin/openclawssy run --agent default --message '/tool time.now {}'
```

Openclawssy is a security-first AI agent runtime in the Ussyverse: one Go binary, explicit controls, auditable runs, and operator-first defaults.

It is for builders who want agent power without mystery behavior, hidden cloud control planes, or hand-wavy safety claims.

## Why Openclawssy

- You can debug agent behavior instead of guessing what happened.
- You can grant capabilities intentionally instead of trusting hidden defaults.
- You can run one agent locally today, then scale to multi-agent orchestration later.
- You can keep one runtime surface across CLI, API, dashboard, scheduler, and chat bridges.
- You can hand this to a team and keep auditability intact.

If you like fast iteration but still need operational guardrails, this is the lane.

## What Makes It Ussycoded

- Built in public, shipped fast, and unapologetically practical.
- Opinionated toward control, traceability, and clear failure modes.
- High-agency tooling for serious builders, not toy prompt demos.
- Weird enough to be fun, disciplined enough to run real workloads.

## Who It Is For

- Engineers building internal agent platforms.
- Solo builders who want local-first control.
- Teams that need audit trails, policy gates, and reproducible behavior.
- Operators who care more about reliability than flashy demos.

## Popular Use Cases

- **Secure coding copilot runtime:** run tool-enabled coding flows with strict path and capability boundaries.
- **Agent ops platform:** provide API + dashboard + audit logs for internal automation teams.
- **Scheduled automation:** run recurring jobs (`cron`) with agent context and replayable outputs.
- **Multi-agent workflows:** split research/build/review work across agents with policy-gated routing.
- **Chat-bridge assistant:** expose the same runtime safely in Discord/Telegram environments.

## Ussyverse Context

## What It Is Great At

- Building a controllable coding/automation agent that can use tools without escaping your policy boundaries.
- Running long-lived assistant workflows with scheduler jobs, chat timelines, and recoverable state.
- Operating multi-agent setups with explicit routing and per-agent model profiles.
- Giving teams auditability: reproducible run artifacts, structured errors, and append-only logs.
- Mixing speed with safety through workspace guards, secret redaction, and capability checks.

## Core Capabilities

- Runtime and channels
  - `openclawssy ask`, `openclawssy run`, `openclawssy serve`, `openclawssy cron`
  - `openclawssy remote` delegates to standalone `openclawremoteussy`
  - HTTP APIs for runs and chat queueing
  - Dashboard admin surface for status/config/scheduler/secrets/docs
  - Discord bridge with allowlists and rate limiting

- Agent and policy control
  - Agent lifecycle tools (`agent.list`, `agent.create`, `agent.switch`)
  - Per-agent config profiles (`agents.profiles.<agent_id>`) with model override fields
  - Inter-agent tooling (`agent.message.send`, `agent.message.inbox`, `agent.run`)
  - Workspace skill loading (`skill.list`, `skill.read`) plus built-in `clawdefuckifier` bootstrap with a globally seeded workspace skill
  - Policy-gated admin operations (`policy.admin` for sensitive cross-agent edits)

- Safety and observability
  - Workspace/path guards, symlink-safe write checks, and control-plane file protection
  - Structured tool errors and bounded loop execution
  - Persisted bundles per run (`input`, `prompt`, `toolcalls`, `output`, `meta`)
  - Audit logs with redaction behavior
  - Agent Monitor UI for main runs + subagent runs with task IDs, model info, and cancel controls
  - Automatic checkpoint trails for `clawdefuckifier*` agents under `workspace/clawdefuckifier/<agent-id>/`
  - Global workspace skill availability at `workspace/skills/clawdefuckifier.md` so any agent can discover and load the repair workflow
  - Memory admin endpoint (`GET /api/admin/memory/<agent>`) with health + embedding stats

- Provider UX
  - Hatz model discovery from Settings with inline `Query models`
  - Automatic `model.name` dropdown once Hatz models are loaded
  - Inline API key prompt in Settings when a discovery-enabled provider is missing a stored key

- Memory system
  - Event stream persisted under `.openclawssy/agents/<agent>/memory/events/*.jsonl`
  - Working memory store with tools (`memory.search`, `memory.write`, `memory.update`, `memory.forget`, `memory.health`)
  - Decision logging + checkpoint distillation (`decision.log`, `memory.checkpoint`)
  - Prompt-time recall injection with bounded memory context
  - Weekly maintenance (`memory.maintenance`) and proactive messaging triggers
  - Optional embeddings + semantic hybrid recall (OpenRouter/OpenAI-compatible providers)

## Installation

Pick a path:

- **Docker:** fastest for most users; good default for trying it now.
- **Build from source:** best for contributors or custom runtime modifications.

Provider note: set at least one provider API key (for example `ZAI_API_KEY` or `HATZ_API_KEY`), then run `setup` + `doctor -v`.

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)

Docker is the fastest way to get started. The backend runs in one container and spawns a separate isolated sandbox container for each agent's workspace.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v ~/.openclawssy:/app/.openclawssy \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e ZAI_API_KEY=your-key-here \
  -e OPENCLAWSSY_TOKEN=change-me \
  ghcr.io/openclawssy/openclawssy:latest
```

The socket mount (`-v /var/run/docker.sock:...`) lets the backend talk to Docker to create sandbox containers. This is a Unix socket, not HTTP.

If you want stricter isolation controls without changing default UX, enable opt-in hardening via `sandbox.docker.hardened=true` and (recommended) `sandbox.docker.require_dedicated_daemon=true` with a non-default `sandbox.docker.host` endpoint.

Keep the quick-start minimal: for most users, only `ZAI_API_KEY` and (optionally) `OPENCLAWSSY_TOKEN` are needed.
For hardening and advanced Docker options, see [`DOCKER.md`](DOCKER.md).

Or use the included `docker-compose.yml` in the repo root:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

See [`DOCKER.md`](DOCKER.md) for full details on architecture, configuration, and permissions.

### Option B: Build from Source

Prerequisite: Go 1.24+

```bash
make build
```

Then run the interactive setup:

```bash
./bin/openclawssy setup
./bin/openclawssy doctor -v
./bin/openclawssy serve --token change-me
```

To enable the Docker sandbox when running from a native build:

```bash
./bin/openclawssy serve --token change-me --sandbox-active --sandbox-provider docker
```

This requires Docker to be installed and the Docker socket accessible.

### Access the Dashboard

Once the server is running, open:

- `https://127.0.0.1:8080/dashboard` (TLS enabled)
- `http://127.0.0.1:8080/dashboard` (TLS disabled)

At first load, the dashboard asks for the same bearer token you passed to `serve`.

Good first dashboard flow:

1. Open Chat and send a simple prompt (`hello`)
2. Run a tool-backed prompt (`/tool time.now {}`)
3. Toggle `Tool timeline` in Chat when you want inline tool bubbles with expandable args/output/error
4. If a long response is interrupted, use `Resume interrupted run` in Chat instead of retyping `continue`
5. Open `Workspace` to browse files the agent is creating and preview text output live from the browser
6. Open run details to inspect tool summary + artifacts
7. Open Agent Monitor to watch main/subagent execution and cancellation state
8. Check Settings/Secrets/Scheduler pages for operator controls, including `model.timeout_ms`

For a full frontend guide, see [`docs/DASHBOARD.md`](docs/DASHBOARD.md).

## How To Use It

If you just installed, this is a good first sequence:

```bash
./bin/openclawssy doctor -v
./bin/openclawssy ask "hello"
./bin/openclawssy run --agent default --message "summarize this repository"
```

- Fast local run:

```bash
./bin/openclawssy ask "hello"
```

- Tool-driven run:

```bash
./bin/openclawssy run --agent default --message '/tool time.now {}'
```

- API run:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/runs \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer change-me' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"agent_id":"default","message":"summarize project status"}'
```

## OpenClaw Remote Integration (External Repo)

OpenClaw remote support is now split into its own repository: `openclawremoteussy`.

Pull/update it from Openclawssy:

```bash
openclawssy remote pull
```

Then build and wire it:

```bash
go -C .openclawssy/external/openclawremoteussy build ./cmd/openclawremoteussy
```

Set `.openclawssy/config.json`:

- `openclaw.remote.enabled=true`
- `openclaw.remote.binary_path=.openclawssy/external/openclawremoteussy/openclawremoteussy`

Store gateway token in secret store key `openclaw/remote/auth_token`, then run:

```bash
openclawssy remote status
openclawssy remote send "What is up? Also, what model are you using?"
```

## Prototype Warning

This is still a prototype under active development.

- Expect breaking changes.
- Use isolated environments and test credentials only.
- Do not run production-critical workloads on it yet.
