# Add these to your skills index

## Context
- Source note: `reconstitute/docs/notes/reconstitute/reconstitution-cli.md`
- Category: `reconstitute`

## Draft Requirements
- [[skill.inventory_opencode_data]]
- [[skill.map_projects_under_workspace]]
- [[skill.harvest_tool_output]]
- [[skill.recover_from_session_diff]]
- [[skill.snapshot_recover_targeted]]
- [[skill.semantic_expand_no_embeddings]]
- [[skill.semantic_expand_with_embeddings_optional]]
- [[skill.llm_writer_guarded_tools]]
- [[skill.run_manifest_and_hashes]]
- ~/.local/share/opencode
- storage/
- tool-output/

## Summary Snippets
- Here’s the **next layer**: skills that (1) **understand the actual OpenCode storage layout you showed**, (2) pull evidence not just from `storage/message` but also `tool-output/`, `session_diff/`, and `snapshot/`, and (3) set you up for either **handoff-to-coding-agent** *or* a **tool-guarded reconstitution agent**.
- Below are **full file contents** (no diffs). Drop these alongside the pack you already started.

## Open Questions
- What should be implemented first from this note?
- Which parts are exploratory versus actionable?
