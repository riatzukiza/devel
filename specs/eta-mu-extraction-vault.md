# Fork Tales → Eta-Mu Extraction Vault

> *What wants to exist separately, must be cut free.*

## Purpose

`fork_tales` is a vault — a corpus of ideas, experiments, and dense hacks. Each "presence," "panel," and "muse" was meant to share the same intelligence system substrate. That substrate is what we're capturing in the eta-mu monorepo.

This document catalogs the distinct systems buried inside, their contracts, and their extraction paths.

## Systems That Want to Exist

### 1. Presence System

**What it is:**
Named entities in a field with anchors, roles, and budget governance. Not just "users" — presences are *positions* in a semantic space, each with its own DAIMON (distributed AI monitor) budget, context, and coordination role.

**Key concepts:**
- `presence_id` — unique position identifier
- DAIMON budgets — resource allocation per-presence
- Field assignment — which semantic field a presence inhabits
- Handoff protocol — CAS-style ownership transfer

**Extraction path:**
```
packages/presence-core/
├── src/
│   ├── presence.ts         # Core presence type
│   ├── daimon-budget.ts    # Budget governance
│   ├── handoff.ts          # Ownership transfer
│   └── field-assignment.ts # Semantic field mapping
└── package.json
```

**Source vault files (concepts only, do not copy):**
- `world_web/presence_runtime.py` — Redis-backed presence state
- `world_web/constants.py` — `PRESENCE_OPERATIONAL_ROLE_BY_ID`
- `world_web/simulation_backend_particles.py` — `_PARTICLE_ROLE_BY_PRESENCE`

---

### 2. Muse System

**What it is:**
Agent runtime with modes, resource claims, context manifests, and media handling. Muses *run* on behalf of presences, with GPU claims, mode switching, and threat fallback strategies.

**Key concepts:**
- `muse_id` — agent instance identifier
- Mode strategy — `witness_thread`, `chaos`, `github_security_review`, etc.
- Resource node — GPU/memory claims
- Context manifest — what the muse knows
- Media strategy — audio/image intent classification

**Extraction path:**
```
packages/muse-core/
├── src/
│   ├── muse.ts              # Core muse type
│   ├── mode-strategy.ts     # Mode selection
│   ├── resource-node.ts     # Claims management
│   ├── context-manifest.ts  # Context assembly
│   └── media-strategy.ts    # Intent classification
└── package.json
```

**Source vault files (concepts only):**
- `world_web/muse_runtime.py` — Main runtime
- `world_web/muse_mode_strategy.py` — Mode selection
- `world_web/muse_media_strategy.py` — Media handling
- `world_web/muse_threat_fallback_strategy.py` — Fallback routing

---

### 3. Panel Composition System

**What it is:**
React UI layer that composes "panels" — self-contained views that can be pinned, floated, and arranged. Each panel connects to a presence or substrate service.

**Key concepts:**
- `WorldPanelLayoutEntry` — panel position and anchor
- `PanelWindowState` — float/dock/pinned state
- `OverlayApi` — shared overlay surface for panels
- Panel types: ThreatRadar, WebGraphWeaver, MusePresence, DaimoiPresence, etc.

**Extraction path:**
```
packages/panel-composer/
├── src/
│   ├── panel-layout.ts      # Layout engine
│   ├── panel-state.ts       # Window state management
│   ├── overlay-api.ts       # Shared overlay surface
│   └── panels/              # Panel component registry
│       ├── threat-radar.tsx
│       ├── presence-call-deck.tsx
│       └── catalog.tsx
└── package.json
```

**Source vault files:**
- `frontend/src/app/worldPanelLayout.ts` — Layout primitives
- `frontend/src/app/appShellTypes.ts` — Types
- `frontend/src/components/Panels/*.tsx` — Panel implementations

---

### 4. Web Graph Weaver

**What it is:**
Web crawler and RSS feed consumer. Fetches pages, follows links, builds knowledge graph. Was the RSS seed source for Threat Radar.

**Key concepts:**
- Watchlist seeds — URLs to crawl
- Robots.txt compliance
- Concurrency limits, depth limits
- WebSocket streaming of crawl progress
- ArXiv, Wikipedia, feed extraction

**Extraction path:**
```
packages/web-graph-weaver/
├── src/
│   ├── weaver.ts           # Core crawler
│   ├── watchlist.ts        # Seed management
│   ├── feed-parser.ts      # RSS/Atom handling
│   ├── robots.ts           # Robots.txt
│   └── knowledge-graph.ts  # Node/edge extraction
└── package.json
```

**Source vault files:**
- `part64/code/web_graph_weaver.js` — Full implementation
- Uses `@open-hax/signal-watchlists` and `@open-hax/signal-source-utils`

---

### 5. Lore / Entity Manifest

**What it is:**
Canonical definitions of entities, voice lines, role hints, and system prompt templates. The "characters" in the simulation.

**Key concepts:**
- `ENTITY_MANIFEST` — all entity definitions
- `VOICE_LINE_BANK` — localized voice lines (ja/en)
- `NAME_HINTS`, `ROLE_HINTS` — semantic hints
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` — LLM prompts

**Extraction path:**
```
packages/lore/
├── src/
│   ├── entities.ts        # Entity manifest types
│   ├── voice-lines.ts     # Localized lines
│   ├── hints.ts           # Name/role hints
│   └── prompts.ts         # System templates
└── package.json
```

**Source vault files:**
- `code/lore.py` — All definitions

---

### 6. Myth Bridge

**What it is:**
Event bridge between simulation and external systems. Emits `cover_field_presence` events and handles `media_presence` attribution.

**Extraction path:**
```
packages/myth-bridge/
├── src/
│   ├── bridge.ts           # Event bridge
│   └── attribution.ts      # Media attribution

---

### 7. Threat Radar (✓ Already Extracted)

**Status:** Already exists as `packages/radar-core`.

**What it is:**
Signal definitions, assessment packets, evidence indexing, reduction, and snapshot sealing.

**Next steps:**
- Add RSS adapter (`rss-adapter.ts`)
- Add Discord output channel

---

### 8. Daimoi System (Field Physics)

**What it is:**
Particle dynamics for semantic fields. Each presence has a "daimon" that moves through the field based on attraction/repulsion rules, collision semantics, and resource economics.

**Key concepts:**
- `DAIMO_FORCE_KAPPA`, `DAIMO_DAMPING` — physics parameters
- Quadtree spatial indexing
- Collision semantics
- Field absorption

**Extraction path:**
```
packages/daimoi-core/
├── src/
│   ├── physics.ts          # Force calculations
│   ├── quadtree.ts         # Spatial indexing
│   ├── collision.ts        # Collision detection
│   └── field.ts            # Field abstraction
└── package.json
```

**Source vault files:**
- `world_web/daimoi_*.py` — All daimoi modules

---

### 9. World Building (Narrative Layer)

**What it is:**
Not code — the story universe, character profiles, world bible. Gates of Truth lore.

**Extraction path:**
Keep in vault. Reference for narrative coherence, do not migrate to code packages.

**Source vault files:**
- `world_building/bible/World_Bible.md`
- `world_building/characters/Character_Profiles.md`
- `MANUSCRIPT_FULL.md`

---

### 10. Simulation Backend

**What it is:**
The core world simulation — particles, fields, WebSocket broadcasting, state management. Massive coupling (397KB `simulation.py`).

**Status:** DO NOT MIGRATE AS-IS. Extract concepts only.

**Key concepts:**
- Tick-based simulation
- Particle system
- WebSocket delta protocol
- Governor rate limiting

**Extraction requires:**
- Complete rewrite, not migration
- Extract `packages/simulation-core/` from first principles
