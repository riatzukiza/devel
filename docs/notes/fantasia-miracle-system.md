# Examples of miracles
The following is a rough sketch of the miracle system and examples of it's use


## mechanics

Miracles must be verified/accepted by your clergy and people
The miracle must be attributed to a member of your pantheon
the event must be "signifigant". It must be something that
agents continue to talk about for a long time afterwards

An example from history is Emperor Constantine seeing the cross
in a vision and painting it on his men's shields and their victory
is attributed to Christ, legalizing the practice, and beginning slow
process of Rome's complete conversion to Christianity.


### Verification

Verificaction of a miracle is a process of consensus that is highly depended on the structure of your religion.
At a high level, this is the result of enough agents (aligned or not) explaining an event
as an act of divine intervention

### Attribution
Your people could attribute it to any diety, not just your patron deity. It is important they attribute it to you.
So if you are intentionally trying to cultivate certain abilities, it's important that your religious iconography,
mythology, etc have symbolic ties to the events you are trying to create and the type of ability you want.
If a miracle is wittnessed, no  matter how much of a hand yoou played in it, if there is no way to symbolicly
tie your symbols to the event, they won't attribute it to you unless they also cannot attribute it to any other diety.

If it's a completely unique miracle they may create a new god (if they are faithful to your pantheon that god will be added to your list of gods)
or attribute it to you any way, which will result in your myth changing which can have side effects in other areas of your control and power

### Signifigance

Really anything can be considered a miracle regardless of signifigance, but only signifigant miracles have long term affects.
Minor miracles will only increase the faith of your people.
Sigifigant miracles can change the nature of your abilities religion.
The longer a miraclulous event remains in the community dialog, the greater the effects.
there are tiers. it's based on number of mentions to the miracle

The first mentions of a miracle are worth less than later ones

## Priors
- allies are unconfident (different from low morale but related, a team could have very high morale with
  little belief they will survive an encounter if properly motivated
  (maybe the whole point is to buy some time, not the victory))
- The enemies are clearly shaken by what happened
- maybe one of your men made a specific prayer and it was symbolicly answered ("God smite my enemies with lightening ", in the most litteral situation) and they spread their experience through social interactions
- enough of them have generated thoughts afterwards attributing the natural act to you
  - depends on the structure of your faith defined in your holy texts
    (documents generated via faithful llm agents that are passed around and increase the faith of those who read them)
    ie if your faith places emphasis on lightening, the sky, storms, wind, etc, ideas that are closely related to
    lightening using cosine similiarity embeddings increases the chance this event is attributed to you
    a mono theistic pantheon might be more symbolic in their associations. 
## Acts of nature

- a river floods during a drought saving the harvest
- lightening strikes an enemy commander resulting in an unlikely victory


## Prophacies
- a member of your faith predicts something others in your colony have no way of knowing correctly
- your mythos includes a prediction that comes true

## effective clergy
If your clergy is say just really good at medicine, and they credit their abilities to god, even if it is a type of science
your people will still attribute this as a miracle, as while it is possible to understand this,
they do not, and this is how it was explained to them.
