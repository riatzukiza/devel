I'm also seeing some resurgence in the old ways of doing these things, again, and again. as always, it seems a lot like we already have the tools to do it all, but when they were made we didn't have the hardware, and so we couldnt' put them together in ways that did thr work we wanted to do and slowly they fell away... Like that prolog thing I linked. Their realizing, again and a again, that though these models are amazing at everything, anything you can do to not use the model to solve part of the problem will make the model work better.

So why do all of your reasoning with the models soft rules, when we have systems that can assert truthyness of a fact given a world of known rules
