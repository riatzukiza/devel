personal namespace, stuff that I want associated with me
The first user of the promethean system.

When I have a personal me idea, I work using the tools I accumulate in these or any other  namespaces I create to represent systems of code I wish to publish, vs things I wish to be known specificlly is me like portfollios, research, bench marks, dot files, etc doesn't matter.
I don't publish code libraries from here. I might write a demo or experiment but

I realized that the seperation of all this into namesdpaces needed me to become the consumer of the tools not just a thing wraqpped up inside of it indistinguishable from it.

To develop interesting things *with* it as well as inside of it.

It's been a bit of a long way getting there but...
