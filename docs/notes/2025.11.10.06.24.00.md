Sometimes I wish I could just think words onto the screen, that'd be so much easier.
But we aren't there yet. I still need to use these fingers

The resistance to typing...
to thinking...
to breathing even...

the adhd mind, the modern mind.

I have to get my brain on straight.
it already is on straight.

the opencode sessions should be locally inspectable
the opencode state files should be a part of the local scope.
`.opencode` should contain an isolated cache

it has far too much global state.
