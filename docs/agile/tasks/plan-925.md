# Plan for Task 925

## Phase 1: Scope & Sources
- Review existing docs in repo about Promethean effects or instrumentation
- Identify keywords and relevant directories for current implementation

## Phase 2: External Research
- Search web for libraries/patterns capturing side effects centrally (TypeScript/Node)
- Look up CQRS/event-sourcing wrappers, middleware logging, aspect-oriented libs
- Capture references for cross-process instrumentation (OpenTelemetry, Temporal, etc.)

## Phase 3: Comparative Analysis
- Summarize notable libraries/patterns, highlight trade-offs and applicability
- Map findings to Promethean needs: instrumentation, metadata bus, invariants

## Phase 4: Reporting
- Draft structured report with summary, methodology, findings, recommendations
- Save to docs/reports/research/promethean-effects-instrumentation.md
